It outperforms it's competitors and some of the Nvidia vanilla cards without demanding a new power supply, assuming you have a 400W or above already. Unlike the original 1650 and lower models, this requires a 6-pin PCIe connector, which isn't asking much considering it being just a bit above the limit where you wouldn't need one, this card does however run hot, was nearing 80C on Ultra playing Dead By Daylight (thanks again to Asus for the free game back in 2016 from my 950 mini purchase), I did not pay attention to the other settings, just switched to Ultra and started playing, it's not perfect, however, even on ultra I was still getting noticeably better performance than my now broken Zotac 1050 Ti that was struggling on medium, that shows the huge loop in performance just within the next line of cards and having the OC addition of an already upgraded card. Though, Nvidia made their lineup rather confusing and a bit frustrating for some this time around, especially for those who have already chosen the vanilla 1650 which happens to be the same price at the moment, I appreciate their effort into making a card (from all manufacturers) that despite it's inferior specs to some of the competition, can still outperform some of those cards, whether all the time or at some point in a game, depending on the model of course, and without the need to upgrade to more power, sizable form-factors, and even specs, which shows that even that doesn't tell the whole deal on performance. The only real downside about this I can say is it seems a little fragile with what looks to be thinner PCB, shroud, and backplate, and it runs very hot, especially boosted. What I do like about the card is Asus's effort into thinking about other factors in design like dust-resistance and fan bearings. I've had 3 cards fail because the bearings would wear out within a year or two and start grinding without even many hours into the games, or at least many being the \"typical\" gamer average, I'm talking failure within about 5 hours of playing a demanding game after just doing minor graphical tasks on every other instance for the span of 1-2 years. After the card nears 80, it does downclock at some point so that it could get back into the mid-70s without a huge performance loss but temperature is certainly its weak point; the heatsink and overall heat dissipation setup is rather small as well, so that doesn't help. After having 3 cards fail, longevity has been my main concern; these little cards just seem to give out rather early. I'm hoping the new bearings, IP5X dust-resistance, and technology behind the card will help its lifespan, and that the heat won't become an issue for the card itself, performance, and rest of my components. With a 1850+Mhz clock boost, at its size, it's power requirements, and it's performance, this thing is a beast in a compact package, not just with what it can do but the thought behind the specs and technology of the card and its components as well. It's nice to see a company for once make a positive change, and not release the same exact design for a basic card despite the lineup difference. Hopefully other companies can take note and start using something like ball bearings for their fans and take into account little issues vulnerable components can face and put more thought into their cards, however, with this Asus, temperature is the only real concerning problem that I would say maybe they haven't put much thought into as far as that regard, maybe all out performance was their focus, or maybe didn't think it would be an issue? Either way, this is a nice card, I chose this version over the Zotac mainly because of the bearings and tech behind it, also it was only $5 more and is factory OC'd. After 3 bad Zotac experiences, I think my choice was justified.\n\nPros:\n\n*Excellent performance for its class and size.\n\n*Fairly compact single fan design with minor fitting issues I ran into with the backplate needing to budge/be pulled hard and held toward the screw holes to put the screws in.\n\n*Extra thought into the design of some of the most important components\n\n*Does look nice imo with the \"ASUS Geforce GTX\" font on the side while viewing inside the case.\n\nCons:\n\n*Runs hot with small heat dissipation setup and not much that can be done to resolve the issue\n\n*Could have looked a little nicer in terms of aesthetics but with something like this already, that's just nitpicking, though I'm sure it could have been done.\n\n*Packaging might have been missing stuff, or ditched GPU Tweak II CD but it might have been done intentionally on this model. Box is rather barebones once you lift the cardboard holding the card, so I feel it could have been downsized to save on materials.\n\nMix:\n\n*build quality seems just average, or less than what I'd like it to be, just a standard card made to do one job, but feels a little fragile with what seems to be thinner parts and some low-quality feeling materials. Hard to tell its durability and strength. The PCB and backplate seem a little thinner than usual or what I'm used to, and the plastic shroud just feels lightweight/cheap and/or thin of itself, not sure about the actual quality of all the components though. Could just be using not necessarily lower-grade but different materials. Who knows? Could end up being better, at least I hope.\n\nUPDATE: 3/23/21. ASUS, please keep using ball-bearing fans and I'll buy your cards every single time, since no other company seems to think about fan design and longevity, my last 3-4 cards died between 1 and 3 years from fan-failure because the sleeve bearings would go bad and start grinding from drastic temperature changes after playing some demanding games."}, {"title": "Perked up my old Lenovo", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2020", "text": "I purchased this to replace the factory installed GT730 on my Lenovo Ideacentre 710-25ISH I bought from Best Buy six or so years ago. I tried streaming Train Simulator 2020 on Twitch and a friend commented that the capture was laggy. I had noticed that my PC would take a hit on frames in high traffic areas, and could only play on medium detail settings at best. I purchased an EVGA 750 G5 Gold-Series modular power supply at the same time as the 1650 to ensure I had more than enough juice for the new GPU before installation. The GPU was larger than I expected but still left plenty of room in the case. I liked the black with white racing stripes design but as I don't have a clear case it will (hopefully) be a long time before I see it again. The GPU plugged right into the PCI slot and snugged right in to the backing plate once it was secured. This GPU did require me to remove a second backing plate in order for it to fit properly, my old 730 only took up the one. This GPU also requires a 4-pin plug connection from the PSU to power it; it will not receive power solely from the PCI slot. I haven't had enough time in Train Simulator to take actual FPS readings, but can tell you the game now runs at its highest detail settings like butter. Zero lag, very smooth, and the added detail is like night and day. This is a great GPU that offers a budget upgrade without hogging up all the space in a tower and demanding a ton of power."}, {"title": "So far, the best value entry level gaming PLUS streaming.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2020", "text": "I bought this thinking I might be able to stream 1080p 60fps but BEWARE there will be a LOT of stutters, duplicated frames during the stream/recording. I do either 900p or 720p for smooth streaming and gaming. Make sure to run OBS as administrator. If you're looking to play and stream at the same time and you don't have a lot of money to spend, this card is a go.\n\nHere are my thoughts. I'm pretty sure you've watched reviews on Youtube but here goes anyways. If you haven't, though, you should.\nNoise: The fans only ramp up during streaming and gaming where the GPU has to work extra hard, otherwise, barely audible if you have a completely quiet room. If you have either speakers or normal headphones, you won't be able to hear the noise at all.\n\nPerformance: You really get what you pay for. You can play triple A games at low or medium settings at 1080p 60fps EASILY. This card doesn't even sweat. As long as you don't ask for too much, you'll be satisfied for sure.\n\nThermals: Averages around 70-75 degree Celsius under full load. Peaks at 75 degrees when you play demanding games for hours, it doesn't go above that at all if you don't overclock it. It's already factory overclocked and still has some room for overclocking.\n\nOverall, this card is one of the best, if not THE best entry level graphics card, and you add streaming to that value. You can't really go wrong with this card. It won't disappoint you. You might think it's bad because of the bad reputation that the normal 1650 has, but this card is on another level. For $20 more bucks, you get 40% more performance than the normal GTX 1650, the new NVENC encoding with Turing architecture for streaming, and in this card's case, overclocked, quiet and excellent cooling."}, {"title": "Pretty loud fans, but great budget performance.", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2020", "text": "Please keep in mind I purchased this card at $180. I would recommend against paying for the Winter 2020 price of this card, as the performance is definitely not worth the current price.\n\nI may have got an excellent copy, but this card can sit at 2GHz overclock pretty happily. Many games can run at 1080 60fps at high or ultra, but you do tend to see the limitations of 4GB VRAM. For workstation usage, having the new NVENC encoder is great for working in Premiere, but again more VRAM would be nice. I don't run many AAA titles but expect to run them around medium-high, which for me is definitely acceptable.\n\nIn terms of the actual TUF 1650S, while I did look for a dual fan for better noise, this card is still pretty loud. It gets annoying when you need to restart your computer often. I believe it isn't the actual air moving, but the fans themselves, as running older cards with different fan designs are much quieter.

This card benchmarks similar or better performance than a nVidia 2070 Super, at a much lower price! That's always been AMD's A game, best bang for the buck, and they've hit that spot again.\n\nNow specifically about this card. I was leary about spending less on a card when the \"bigger name\" brands are $30-$100 more, but I've had XFX cards in the past and they've worked just fine, so I gave this one a shot.\n\nOut of the box, this card was MUCH larger than I expected. I had to move around SATA ports just to get it to fit. I expected it to be around the size of my RX480, but I way underestimated that! So know going in you need to make sure your motherboard layout isn't going to be effected by this card's size. It's much wider and longer than any previous AMD card I've seen.\n\nNow, as for the performance. On boot, everything seemed great. I've always had problems with AMD's drivers, they're notorious for having buggy, crashing driver releases. I've always had multiple system crashes when doing clean installs of AMD's graphics drivers in the past. But doing a complete clean driver install worked flawlessly, no crashes on the driver install. Huge pleasant surprise!\n\nThen I tried playing some games to start testing the performance. That's where I started to run into serious problems. Every game I tried to play, my computer would hard lock. The GPU driver was crashing. Obviously that's incredibly frustrating for a brand new high end graphics card. I tried changing game settings, both in regular gaming and VR, and nothing changed. Drivers would crash every time after getting into the game (though the menus would load fine).\nBefore considering an RMA, I looked into the issue to see how many others were having these problems, and it appears to be a very large number of people. After a couple of hours of digging, I discovered the issue was because the graphics card is overlooked out of the box WAY over stock, and even higher than the highest advertised overclocked cards. This is why it was crashing. This is a serious oversight from a firmware/driver standpoint. The default settings should never be overclocked. The main problem comes from the voltage is set at 1.2mV by default, and the card can't handle that much voltage. You have to undervolt the card, in my case to 0.99mV in order to get the card to run on stock settings.\nThat in itself is a simple enough fix, except that you can't force the card to actually run at those settings by default, you have to use software to change those settings on system startup. And that's where another issue came up. AMD's software for overclocking (or in this case underclocking) their hardware, Wattman, would not save these new settings on startup no matter what I tried. Every boot, even with the software running on startup and the profile saved as default, the card would start with the original default settings. This would be incredibly frustrating to have to manually change the graphics settings on every reboot/crash.\nSo rather than use AMD's software, I had to resort to using other software to manage the settings. In this case MSI AfterBurner. MSI's software has worked flawlessly for years, but it does have issues with compatibility with VR (specifically Oculus), so do keep that in mind if you do a lot of VR gaming.\nThe next issue that I ran into is that apparently AMD's FreeSync does NOT work with this card, at least on the current drivers. So that also had to be disabled, which is incredibly disappointing, but would certainly have to be fixed at some point. So I'm waiting for further driver updates to hopefully be able to turn that back on.\n\nAfter finally getting all of that sorted out, it was finally time to test some games! This thing is an absolute beast for gaming. A massive upgrade from my RX480! I play in 2k resolution, and the RX480 (even if overclocked) would struggle to keep even 30 FPS in some demanding games on high/ultra settings, but not this! I can max out all graphics settings and play at 2k resolution and keep over 60 FPS on every game I've tried! The only notable exception being Star Citizen, but being an Alpha it's terribly poorly optimized, and even the highest end systems struggle to keep 60 FPS everywhere. But I do keep a stable 45 FPS average, which is fantastic. Though most games are able to sustain 144 FPS as well, for an incredible gaming experience! Specially Elite Dangerous stays at 144 FPS even in large battles!\n\nI want to knock more stars off this card just for all the frustration I went through just to get it to even work, but since then I haven't had a single issue with the card. It runs perfectly now! So just go into getting this card (and I would assume other 5700XT boards may have this same issue) knowing that you're going to have to do some tweaks before you'll be able to use it. AMD has the absolute worst driver support, it's downright dreadful. But they've always been this way. If their software team could actually catch up to their hardware team, they'd probably be killing nVidia on all fronts. They just can't.\n\nSo overall, I definitely recommend this card for an upgrade. It was a huge upgrade for me and it's nice to have great gaming performance again. Just know you're going to likely have issues until they sort all of this out!"}, {"title": "2022 AMD Updated Drivers and Fixed Black Screen Issues Card is Amazing", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2022", "text": "This card at launch when I purchased it was plagued with the same video card driver issues AMD has become notorious for in the community.

Keep in mind that all of these improvements whilst still drawing the same power and without overclocking. That's right, stock speed baby.

Can be tempered.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2020", "text": "I think this is really worth 4.5 stars, but I don't want to short-change it.\n\nThis card is pretty great given that it's usually the more budget-conscious of 5700XT. Which is not to say \"it works fine BUT...\" We've skipped some RGB but have a metal backplate and metal accents on a very solid-feeling shroud. Personally I don't care what the shroud feels like - I'm not going to really hold the thing. Make it look nice and call it a day. But the metal brackets and plates don't seem to hurt anything. An aggressive-looking shroud too, but not to a degree that it becomes cringey.\n\nIt's easy to lose reference on size in GPU cards especially when looking at dual-fan designs, and this one is quite large. It has a two-slot interface on the output-end of the card but it has a substantial radiator and does take up three slots worth of space over the motherboard. I had to give up wifi for this. mATX builders take not that you will only really be left with one slot available and miniITX that you may not fit into a tight case.\n\nThe temperatures and fan noise out of the box are the biggest concern here. AMD temperature reporting maybe looks worse than it is, but that isn't to say this card is fairly hot and loud as received due the the factory overclock/overvolt and aggressive fan curves. There is a bios switch to enable a more basic bios with less aggressive fan curves, but while it's easy, it's not going to be the best method of dealing with these issues. Better to use AMD's own Wattman from the Radeon drivers that you'll install anyways and use that to undervolt and tune some clock speeds. There's a very good chance that this will drop your temps enough and keep your fans from running so high. You could further tweak the fan curves to tune the speeds. I know this seems like a lot of overhead and it could encourage you to look elsewhere, but honestly it's not bad and something you should do for any 5700XT. So it's worth doing regardless.\n\nMake sure you have a good power supply, though. Recommended is a 600 W but you'll need both an 8-pin and a 6-pin power. There are adapters included and I won't say they won't work, but conventional wisdom is that you really should use those as a permanent solution. Can't say I've ever heard of it really causing a problem, though.\n\nOverall, I'm happy to have this as it has everything I need and it's very light on the gimmicks. I've got Destiny 2 running at 1440p and highest settings (except lighter AA and no motion blur) around 130-150 fps. A smallish but significant upgrade from my GTX 1080.

I'd recommend avoiding the card.\n\nI purchased a Nitro+ RX 570 8GB from Platinum Micro Inc on 8/29/18 and received the card 9/6/18. My wife and i were about to move so i didn't test the card until 10/4/18 when i found that there was an issue with the card. I tried to trouble shoot the problem myself through the 10/6/18 when i found some postings (see toms hardware, amd support, ect...) , that this was a known issue with the Sapphire cards and likely a bios problem. 17 and 18 series drivers i tried gave me an error reading \"No AMD graphics driver is installed, or the AMD driver is not functioning properly. Please install the AMD driver appropriate for your AMD hardware\" on BIOS 1 and i get frames about the same as my 5 year old 7870 on bios 2. Newer drivers read bios 2 as an RX 580 in GPU-Z and same issue with frame rates. The only way that BIOS 2 functions is with drivers that are almost a year old (17 series drivers) and makes me doubt support for current gen titles coming out this year. I filed for a return on 10/7/18 and was denied as i filed 1 day outside of the window. I first called amazon and asked about their 90 day A-Z guarantee and was told that because the seller was a 3rd party seller the 90 day guarantee didn't apply. I ran through Sapphire support for a few days before they recommended an RMA with their 3rd part RMA company, Althon Micro. Althon Micro has given me an rma number and on their email requested the use of bubble wrap and packing peanuts which with shipping ran about $40. I'm worried though that their fix for the problem is a bios re-flash which would void any factory warranty i have on this card. After this fiasco I'm avoiding sapphire cards.

This GPU has done the job of letting me go anywhere on the internet without video lag.\n\nI had a more expensive NVIDIA GPU in my system with otherwise state of the art hardware. The newest most power Ryzen 9 \\ 5900 CPU, fast memory and a 750 watt power supply. The NVIDIA GPU ran like hot garbage on my Ubuntu system. Ubuntu has a nasty sepia color scheme that saturates the entire OS and everything in it. It is not only ugly but painful to look at due to my vision issues.\n\nI did not know for sure at the time but, I hoped a new video card from someone other than NVIDIA might perform better. Turns out this AMD designed GPU got rid of the nasty sepia tint. This video card creates a simple un-tinted OS that is a pleasure to use. The card is not BIG and uses only the power supplied by the GPU slot.\n\nThe card has some energy saver garbage installed that turns the card off if you power down your monitor. I took a star off for the energy saver mess. There really are no other issues.

that seem to be on peoples mind when contemplating purchasing this exact model rx 5700xt by power color(axrx 5700xt 8gbd6-3dh)\n\nok first this is not a big card, I knew it was going to be on the small side but i did not expect it to be no bigger than the older model rx 570s from the likes of gigabyte or xfx and actually when i hold them up side by side this card is actually smaller than my Nvidia rtx 2060 super founders card and that was a surprisingly small card, so this is a perfect size for the case i have included in the photos thats the case i have put this card into\n--given this cards petite build and very light weight i had ZERO expectations for good thermal management...but continue reading and i think i will effectively covey just how wrong i was about that but keep in mind that this case has the gpu literally right on the side with a massive intake basically spanning the entire side of the case were the pcie slot is so that is undoubtedly influencing my thermals and fan noise\nok on to performance. first lets identify my hardware here with a list of my parts that are in this build so we can get a better idea of how well this runs as a complete product because how useless are gpu performance and thermal numbers without knowing full system specs and how the performance and thermals of a graphics card influences total system performance\n*case - silverstone sugo sg13b mesh\n*cpu - intel i7 8700k\n*cpu cooler - corsair h60(2018) 120mm closed loop liquid cooler\n*motherboard - msi z370i pro carbon mini itx\n*ram - corsair vengance pro ddr4 16gb(2x8gb) at 3600mhz at cas16\n*ssd - samsung 950 pro(first gen) m.2 nVME 512gb ssd for windows 10\n*ssd - silicon power a40 256gb sata 2.5in ssd for a cut down debian linux install for phoronix test suite(for testing)\n*hdd - Western Digital white label 8TB red drive that runs at 5900rpm pulled from a WD external drive\n*psu - Thermaltake white label 700watt 80+ white certified( this was a concern at first as i was not confedent this was going to be able to power all my hardware reliably and altho i have long term usage concerns now after i replaced the 120mm fan with a pwm fan and ran the pwm signal wire to the motherboard for advanced thermal control i am not worried at the moment but i will look into picking up a at least bronze certified of the same specs but also keep in mind that with this form factor the only system fans i have are the intake 120mm for the AIO cooler and the 120mm on the power supply so i needed to mod this in order to have more granular control of both fans and i must say im super stoked that i did because all that in this case makes for a perfect air duct from the front over the board and out the back via the psu now adding a relatively hot GPU into the mix was the last thing i wanted but looking at the total system performance im shur glad i did because of the way this case is built this gpu easily pulls in its own fresh air from the side and throws ip up towards the vents on top so even if this gpu hits 90c on the junction it end up having very little effect on full system temps\nok giving all those specs i was not expecting super high performance even tho there is no reason a i7 8700k cant still handle high fps gaming at a modest 2560x1440 at around 120 to 144fps and to my suprise it did just fine\nok on to the thermals wich is arguably the most concerning for people when considering this card and unless i completely won the silicon lottery it duz not need to concern anybody i fan a full 6 hour stress test in furmark and shur my junction temps came close to 90c but never hit that but the core stayed under 80c the hole time and the memory temps stayed under 60c the whole time, ran ran this stress test in conjunction with a small fft stress on my cpu so i could get a total system thermal worse case and that were these temps came from when i just ran the furmark stress test i didn't come anywhere near this high of temps on the card and all together i dont think i ever got higher than 30c above ambient here in Nebraska were its getting a little chili out lol\nok so here are my final thoughts on this, if you are looking for a amd gpu that is very high performance and you dont want to wait for maybe ever for rdna 2 and you need something that is going to fit into a small case with good airflow this is the card for you also it has the added bonus of being slightly obscure so the prices are usly the lowest for a new rx 5700xt at least at the time of righting this, now that being sead if you can afford the price and physical real estate of going with a bigger card with possibly 3fans you will simply have much better performance numbers and even possibly be able to overclock a little bit (by that i mean allow watt man to overclock for you as its basically fully automated at this point im super excited about that little development as i also have the giant xfx rx 5700xt thik 3 model that is setup with dual bios so i can take one and just go to town on the overclock and push close to 220watts, but thats for a different review that i will also be making here on that once my absolute army of tests is done\nok now to address so other concerns i was reading on other reviews...right now as of today the 15th of October 2020 i am running the latest optional drivers from amd and i am seeing ZERO instability and the thermals and total power consumption are well within spec( at he hottest my card was pulling 180watts) and that is with the stock performance setting on wattman no over volt or overclock or the opposite i didn't under clock anything either i specifically wanted to find out what the OUT OF BOX experience was going to be like so i could put some information out there for others to help them make a decision on this seemingly to good to be true obscure graphics card from power color and i believe i have done that...\\\nmy conclusion is if PCPARTSPICKER list is saying this is the best card that will fit in your build than buy it if there are clear options for bigger cards like the red devil or the asus strix than buy one of those instead or even the xfx thic 3 but i have heard of thermal issues with the thic 2 but in reality if your running a normal size none sff case the 3 fan thic 3 is going to fit its no bigger than any other 3 slot card(actually uses only 2 pcie slots but the card itsslef is super thick and takes up 3 internally) ok but thats not the point here were discussing the axrx 5700xt 8gbd6-3dh\nand on that in my experience everybody can set aside there performance concerns and thermal concerns as long as you have good airflow to it this card will run fine\nps after running all the stess tests i dont think my cards fans were ever hitting above 60% or if they were they were just rely quiet and at idle they are off so all in all its not a load card and keep in mind in my case the gpu intake is literally less than an inch from the side vents so i rely was expecting this to be a bit louder and just to clarify i run this system backwards with the io facing me so the gpu was also facing me and still total syste noise was negligible and actually quieter than when i had the rtx 2060 super fe in here as its idle fan speed was like 40% and ramped up to 90 within 5mins of a stress test now am i disparaging nvidia here for there FE coolers NO i love that card but i put that into an even more space constrained aluminum box from aliexpress its very nice and it is a matx sff build nut that was literally the only high performance modern gpu that would fit as it has the power cables on the side and not the top were there is literly no room in between the side aluminum panel and the top of the gpu so i had to sacrifice my more expensive 2060s on that build and that is why i was looking for a replacement for this one as its an older intel platform and not my primary rig but i jumped into this fully expecting to haf to down clock this to basically a 5700 not xt specs or even a 5600 and for the price i was totaly ok with that and was actually one of the deciding factors in picking this model as it uses the reference pcb the from stock rx 5700xt so future water cooling a gpu inside this RIDICULOUSLY small case was just kind of exciting lol and still not off the table now that i find out this card runs just fine at fully stock and is very competitive with my bigger RTX 2070super FE thats what was rely surprising as i paid 499 for that and no were near that for this and ironically this card will perform way better in linux as it is native MESA vesa and will not need to leverage nvidia to volcan runtime conversions and im no levelonetechs but i know my way around linux and rely enjoy tinkering with it and this will enable some pretty good performance numbers for paired with this easly clocked to 5ghz water cooled 8700k so ya im not regretting this purchase one bit...\nbut dont misunderstand me if i find any problems with this card long term i will definitely update this review and then you as a buyer can decide if those issues are a deal breaker in the future but likely there will already be a slurry of other options out there especially once RDNA2 comes to the DIY space but for now and for a while RDNA1 is what we have available as amd is still leveraging market share from the next gen consoles which are using RDNA2 so they will likely try to enjoy the win there for a while befor putting that tech on the DIYPC market and reaffirming the PC as the performance king over any console that way they get 2 wins and quite frankly after the whole FX dry spel and the rx vega flop they kinda need the wins...\n\n...update...ok so 3 months and one debacle of a election later this card is still working perfectly and is even more stable today still using the optional rolling release drivers as opposed to the slightly older LTS drivers so ya no problembs at all...one slight complaint and it's not even a real one but a superficial one with the light weight feel of the whole card, is it is a small card and since it realy dosnt produce the kinda heat a overclocked card running at over 200watts it dosnt need anything more than a cheap light aluminum cooler stack but it still feels cheap lol ...this dosnt effect performance at all at least in this specific card as it simply dosnt need a more dence cooling solution so no real complaints just that one very first world one lol"}, {"title": "Mostly Reliable", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2020", "text": "I

It's giving me the framerates I need to play at high/max settings at 1440p, and a definite performance improvement over the GTX 980Ti I was using previously.\n\nI bought this card as an upgrade from an aging nVidia GTX 980Ti. I have a ASUS ROG Strix X470-I Gaming ITX motherboard, 32GB of DDR3200 CL16 RAM, a AMD Ryzen R7 2700X, and a 1440p FreeSync display (LG 32GK650F).\n\nI needed a card that would fit in my Fractal Design Node 304 case, and many other 5700XT cards were too long to fit into the case and would block back of the power supply. This card is taller than most cards, but it's not as long as the other 5700XTs on the market, so it's able to fit into the Node case better. The Node case has a built-in mesh cutout on the side of the cover next to the GPU slot and that lets the dual fans on this card get cool air.\n\nSince I started using this 5700XT card, I had issues with the graphics driver crashing during long gaming sessions. AMD doesn't have the best reputation for their drivers so I thought it would eventually get fixed in a driver update. But as the weeks passed by and new drivers came out, it continued to randomly crash and I was regretting switching over to an AMD card. I starting to think about returning or selling this card.\n\nI didn't think I'd be the only one with this issue, so I searched some forum posts on Reddit and the usual tech websites. I saw that AMD recommends a 700W power supply for these cards, 600W minimum ( https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/radeon-rx-5700-series-quick-start-guide-en.pdf ). My power supply is a 550W Seasonic Focus Gold+, which is just below AMD's minimum guidance. This suggested to me that the 12V pci-e cable was sagging in voltage and that maybe was what was contributing to making the card crash. On my previous card, the 980Ti, I just ran a single cable that had daisy chained 6 + 2 pci-e connectors and that supplied power to the two pci-e power connectors (one is 8 pin, the other is a 6 pin). The single cable was good enough for my old 980Ti, I thought would work with this new card.\n\nI managed to dig up a second pci-e 8 pin power cable and I attached it in parallel with the other pci-e cable going to this 5700XT card. After I gave each pci-e power connector its own cable, the card has been rock solid despite being on a slightly undersized power supply. The extra cable is now allowing the card to get the power/voltage it needs. It's Ohm's law: as the amperage goes up, the voltage goes down. The load is now split across more wires and there's naturally less resistance and less of a voltage drop. I'll have to remember this for future builds."}, {"title": "Very Good Performance, but I'm concern for the temperatures", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2020", "text": ""}, {"title": "SO FAR, it's excellent", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2019", "text": "I like the design of this card, and comparative reviews show that it has good cooling on the GPU and Memory.

I use this card for about 8 or 9 hours a day, and i use it for gaming and game development in unity. The card works as expected and has no issues running games such as fortnite at 120 fps high settings. you can run ultra as well but you're going to want to cap the frames to 60 fps as to reduce frame drops. Unity runs very well, and is far better at building scenes and generating lighting(which was the biggest problem i had with my 750 ti).\n\npros -\n6 gigabytes of vram.\n\n2 DVI ports to support dual monitors(i tested to ensure this works on windows 10, it does)\n\nDual fans for better cooling. if you buy a 1060 i really recommend buying one with dual fans. it'll last much longer if cooled more adequately. i was worried mine would have cooling problems as i have a small case in a room thats usually about 74 to 75 degrees fahrenheit. but interestingly it only reached 107 fahrenheit under load. which for a gpu is not bad.\n\ncons - none really ;)\n\npretty standard situation here. its a great card of course but it wont function as well as cards higher in the price range, which is to be expected.\nbut for 300 USD this will do everything. i have not tested this against its amd counter part the rx 580/480 or with VR.

The 1050 is a great card but the performance difference is huge while the price difference was moderate. The 1070 is an excellent card but it would end up costing more than my entire computer. Most of the Nvdia 1060 GPUs are roughly the same regardless of the maker. The main difference is the fans/cooling, the appearance, and the ports. This gigabyte offers dual fans that supposedly offer more cooling due to the fan design. I am not sure if its true but the temps have been fairly consistent and the fan is very quiet. Keep in mind that with minimal to moderate use the fans do not come on at all (unlike GPUs of the past) once you reach a certain degree of use the fans will ramp up as needed. Also worth noting is that this generation of Nvida cards have \"auto overclocking\" which means they can adjust their frequency depending on how you are using it. This has worked out very well so far with the card humming with light apps at less than 400mhz and then going to full clock with heavy games. The temperatures are reasonable (about 66 degrees at full load) and the performance has been spotless with my Core i5 setup.\n\nThe only real downside to this is that it comes with no accessories.

It gives you the ability to monitor the card memory, temp, speed as well as the GPU and even your CPU Temps.\nCompared to the GTX 950 2GB card it replaced it runs every game I have at max settings, with ease (the 950 could not run some of my games at max settings without some tearing and lagging). I love it so far and would recommend it to any gamer up to an intermediate level (maybe beyond - depending on the games). It does take two card slots and uses the 6 pin external power connecter on the end of the card. It fit well in my ATX case, does not crowd the HDs or SDDs installed.

Most games at this resolution at high/ultra will fall between 2-3 GB RAM usage, so this will cover most. For now. 6 GB RAM is a little more future proof, while also being way overkill for current games at 1080p. So, totally a personal choice if the extra cost is worth it. The RAM isn't the only difference between the 3 and 6 GB versions, but third party benchmarking reviews would suggest it's the primary noticeable difference.\n\nIn terms of performance if you're upgrading an older 960 to this 1060, how noticeable the upgrade will be depends on the game obviously. For a game like World of Warcraft, you'll see little difference. For a game like Tom Clancy's Wildlands, the difference is noticeable. You had to really dial back settings to get RAM usage down under 2 GB, but are able to jack a lot of settings back up with the 1060 which helps to separate it from its console versions.\n\nIt supports Nvidia Ansel, but that's been hit or miss for me. Doing ultra high resolution screenshots will often crash the supported game (ie: Mass Effect: Andromeda at the highest res Ansel supports will manage to save the screenshot, but will also cause DX 12 crashes to the game). It's tough to say what's at fault there.\n\nAt the price I purchased it here ($180), it was pretty much a no brainer generational update to my old 960 (~$20 less than what I paid for my 960 2 GB when the 960 came out)."}, {"title": "Fast card, nice cooler, But 8Gbps not 9Gbps.", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2017", "text": "Ordinarily this would be one of the most expensive GTX 1060 GPUs on the market, but the GPU market is sort of erratic due to the increase of cryptocurrency mining.

At full load with Furmark, my card maxes out at 69 degrees Celsius. My PC case has five 120mm fans in use to keep air flowing, but it is also closed off inside of a compartment of my desk that constricts airflow.\n\nSo far, this GPU has run every game at 1080p with max settings easily. In Fallout 4, I maxed all settings and the GPU hit 80% usage at its highest. I also tried Tomb Raider (2012), Fable III, and Shogun II: Total War. All ran perfectly with maxed settings.\n\nIt should be noted there is an error on the product description. The GPU's 6GB of RAM operates at 8Gbps, not 9Gbps. There are two versions of this card that are essentially the same. This model is Rev. 2, and it is has 8Gbps memory from Micron. The Rev. 1 model is the one with 9Gbps memory. The performance difference isn't huge between the two, but make sure you know which one you are buying. I kicked one star off for that, because I thought I was getting the 9Gbps model. I'm pleased enough with the card not to want to return it though.\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that this GPU comes with no accessories at all. You get a GPU, a single sheet of paper with instructions on how to put the GPU in your PC, and a driver CD. You don't get any cables, PCI-E adapters or cable adapters. This is somewhat unusual.

However, on the first try plugging in my new RTX 3060 Ti GPU into the riser, I had to use the motherboard graphics port to view what was happening after POST.

Plugged the GPU directly to motherboard without the riser installed and everything showed up fine, so I continued installing drivers like normal. With drivers installed, I decided to go back and see if the riser would work. No such luck. BIOS and Device Manager still won't recognize that a GPU is install. So now I suspect this is a PCIe v4.0 compatibility problem as this riser cable is a PCIe v3.0. My motherboard is a ASUS Intel ROG MAXIMUS XI HERO that is also PCIe v3.0, so in theory, this riser should have worked, especially when GPU work fine directly plugged into the mother board as the GPU is both PCIe v3.0 and v4.0 compatible. I've professionally worked electronics and IT for over 35 years and I inspected the connector contacts and everything looks perfect.

It ran any game a threw at it in 1680 x 1050 4x AA 8x AF while maintaining about 100fps and higher (can do about 400-500 in CS:S). This card is huge, and a bit heavy for a video card. I do like the cover on the card because I can just grab the card with my hand, and not worry about breaking or bending anything. It uses 2x 6-pin PCI-E cords, and they are located on the side facing the left side of the case. This allows them to be out of the way of the hard drive cage if that were to be an issue. I believe it is about 5-10mm longer than your standard ATX motherboard. So if you need to measure, just see if you have an 1\" to 1-1/2\" of space between your motherboard and hard drives, and you will be fine.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks though, my 260 started having issues.\n\nNo matter what game, or how low the settings were, the card would shoot up to 90C and higher. Eventually it would hit the thermal threshold and restart the computer. I have a CM690 case, which has enough ventilation, but I even bought more fans. The card kept overheating for no reason, even when I had the fan run 100% at all times. The funny thing is, if it was 50-60C at idle, I would open up one of the Vista games, and it would jump back down to high 40C. Now this shouldn't happen when my Core 2 Duo E8400 was only running 40C under load.\n\nI did some research around the internet, and saw a lot of forums where at least one person(per forum) was having a similar issue. I even opened up a thread on the EVGA forums to debunk the issue. They pointed to bad ventilation, but I got more powerful front and side fans and two 140mm fans for my case, to go on the top and bottom. I even re-arranged the power cords (modular PSU) to allow for more ventilation, all of that only delayed the overheating. Then the EVGA users pointed to the power supply, and asked me to check the rails. All of the voltages were above average (tested on an industrial Fluke meter). I even traded out the motherboard (EVGA 730i -> EVGA 790i Ultra) because the northbridge was heating up a lot too. Still the video card overheated.\n\nI eventually ended up stepping up to a 275 GTX (which was faster and $20 less than this card at the time). Since then no video card overheating problems, and my 275 has been through hotter weather than my 260 had been in.\n\nThis card is a fast card, but most people were/are getting \"lemons\" like I did. If you get this card and don't have overheating issues, then you have a good deal. If you do not feel like going through what I went through, go ahead and get a base GTX 275. The 275 runs just as fast, if not faster, and runs cooler than this 260. EVGA of course is the best tech support in the business, so any video card you get should be an EVGA. I have never been disappointed with their tech support, and I have owned a 5200FX, 6600, 6800, 260, and 275 (all EVGA) and have always been happy after getting off the phone with them when I have a problem."}, {"title": "Works well with a 3-year old PC", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2009", "text": "I bought this card to upgrade my existing PC (see specs below). That PC is almost 3 years old and with a new card, power supply, and more memory, I hope to get another 3 years out of it, before looking for a replacement. The cost of the card (and power supply, and more memory) is expected to be about one-third of the price of a current day equivalent replacement PC\n\nInstallation\nPhysical installation was pretty straightforward , and took 5-10 minutes. As other reviewer have noted, the card is long indeed (a little over 10 inches), but it fit in the case with room to spare. One thing I noticed was that in my pc, the card covered 2 PCI slots (one PCI express, one non-PCI express), while using only one (the PCI Express). Results may vary in your situation.\nSoftware installation was a little more cumbersome, but it may have been caused that Windows Auto Update tried to install software during the installation of the driver software. I ended up crashing the computer and had to install the drivers a total of 3 times. Again, not sure if this had to do with the drivers themselves.\n\nThe software is pretty straightforward, and it comes with trial version of a handy tool (\"FRAPS\"). This tool allows you to measure framerates among other things. It appears that you can record screen shots and movies of your games as well, but I have not tried that functionality.\n\nOnce installed I tested it on 3 games:\nCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. This game allowed me to run with all possible options maxed out at 1900x1200, while achieving a framerate in the 60-70 range at graphic intensive points. (An example would be a scene at night in the rain, with lots of movement). At other time fps was well above 100\nAssassins Creed. Again I was able to run with all option maxed out at 1900x1200. The framerate hovered in the 35-40 range when churning through graphic intensive scenes; higher at other times. While not as high as hoped, I did not notice too much flickering\nCrysis SP Demo. I downloaded the demo when it first came out. It did run on the NVIDIA 7900 GS, but only at Medium settings in a 1200x768 resolution. Even then, the screen would sometimes flicker and stutter. With the new card, I could run it at high, in 1200*768 while achieving a fps of 30. I did not notice any noticeable flickering.\n\nNote: I did have to buy a new power supply, because the standard PSU that comes with the Dell is rated at 375W, which is not enough for this card. If you google a bit you can find a calculator that let's you estimate the total power need for your PC. It estimated my power need at 390W. I decided to go with a 550W PSU. It appears to be working well\n\nOverall, I think this card has given my computer an extension on life.

I play games on this card like the Battlefield series, Kingdoms of Amulur and Assassins Creed III and it handles them just fine.\n\nThe card itself is robust. I do video editing and due to the number of CUDA cores, it takes a 2.3hours movie it gets it done in about 20 minutes. Temperature is fine during the process. I can hit 64 degrees at a fan speed of 40%. Ran tests, got to 69 degrees at full load and fan kicked in to 68% so it cools very well. The cooling is great because it is actually channeled from inside the card straight to the back. Most cards today are open so all that heat goes in to your case, this card gets ALL that heat out the case.\n\nOne drawback to this card is that it can only due up to DirectX 10 so the newer games might not look as well, but time will tell.\n\nMust be a great card because I want another one to put them in SLI, but can never find the exact model. Which brings me to my next point. The temperatures may be affected because there are two of these, there is a 65nm one and then there is the 55nm one. The 55nm ones run really cool; no matter what you throw at it. The 65nm ones tend to get hotter so look for the 55nm.\n\nAll in all this is still a good card for a few more years. Well worth the price when I bought it.\nAlso be advised, this is not a small video card so be careful, I put this in an Antec 900 gaming case and I have to lose a drive bay.

Upon receipt of the card, I tested it under minimal load and found it did work. I had installed the card as card #2 in a dual-SLI setup (keep in mind, the #2 card will always run cooler than the #1 card). However, when running Fallout 3, the card began to blue-screen when the temp reached 45 deg. C.\nI removed the card and disassembled the cooler to give it a new application of Arctic MX4 thermal paste. During this procedure, I noticed the inside of the PCI bracket showed signs of some terrific heat: the metal was scorched and discolored.\nNone of the chips showed any signs of scorching, however, and after applying fresh MX3, the temps lowered a few degrees C, keeping it well below 45 deg. C, thus avoiding the blue-screening, at least while in the #2 position.\nI guess that for the price i paid, i should have expected the card to be less-than-perfect, but this card was definitely not well taken care of. In fact, it was abused. Thus, the description should have said it was in \"fair\" or \"working\" condition, but not \"Very Good\" as advertised, though one can't expect the seller to have tested the card as thoroughly as I did.\nAs long as i keep the temps down, it performs adequately, but i have to be careful to keep the operating conditions very, very cool.\nWhile the card's cooler was removed, i took the opportunity to replace the impeller fan with one from identical card whose cooler was replaced with an Arctic Accelero Extreme GTX cooler, one with practically no use, and it runs a bit quieter that the one that came with this card.\nUltimately, I will replace the stock cooler with an Accelero Extreme like my #1 card, and that will prevent the card from reaching 45 deg. C and the resulting blue-screening, but newer games like Crysis 2 will still drive the card to about 50 deg.

This is a 300 watt card but default setting limits it to drawing 250 watts and even rage mode limits it to drawing 280 watts- both of these result in performance that is below what it should be stock(not sure if this is a Sapphire issue or an AMD driver issue). Make sure you set your profile to manual and set the power tuning limit to max- this will allow the card to draw the full 300 watts and clock itself the way AMD intended under load.

This is a 300 watt card but default setting limits it to drawing 250 watts and even rage mode limits it to drawing 280 watts- both of these result in performance that is below what it should be stock(not sure if this is a Sapphire issue or an AMD driver issue). Make sure you set your profile to manual and set the power tuning limit to max- this will allow the card to draw the full 300 watts and clock itself the way AMD intended under load.

Without the proprietary driver, Linux defaults to a generic VGA-style driver that doesn't provide hardware optimizations.\n\nI was kind of pushed into this upgrade, since I wanted to move to the latest CentOS release. The new release requires a newer version of the AMD driver, and that new driver no longer supports the old Radeon HD 3450.

If you're getting it to with hopes of playing all your games at 60fps 1080p or something, well, you really shouldn't be looking at this card. Its a great card if you're not going into it with high-expectations.\n\nUpdate:\nThe card still works. However two months ago the pc started bluescreening. I though it was a graphics driver issue because the BSOD code or whatever kept pointing to ATI something or the other. Long story short, the thing was overheating and crashing. I'm not really sure why it decides to do this now, it was working fine up till this point streaming movies pretty much 24-7. Maybe the thermal paste needs to be replaced... but it feels like the heatsink is absorbing the heat well enough - it physically burns the skin to the touch, ouch!\n\nI 'fixed' this by mounting a small fan to the side of the case that blows air directly across it. It hasn't blue screen since. However the case the pc was originally in didn't have a place for a fan on the side panel so I did have to swap cases out too. I already had a spare case (go figure) so it didn't cost me anything. Still, if you plan to use this in a small little case with poor ventilation you may want to consider a card that has a little fan on it to help keep it cool.\n\nIf you're not using it in such a small hotbox of a case however you should be just fine. If not, smack a fan in there somewhere and that should take care of it.

The PC I use this in is set up to run either Win 7 or 8 (now 8.1). 8 crashed repeatedly, which I thought was 8's fault. I eventually realized the problem had to be related to the Nvidia card even though there were no problems with Win 7. I did some googling and found out the Nvidia's drivers are not fully compatible with Win 8 and can cause MAJOR crashes. We're not talking just BSOD's, we're talking SO much damage to the file system that the OS has to be reinstalled.\n\nSince I replaced the Nvidia card with this, Win 8.1 has been quite stable, so the problem was definitely the Nvidia drivers.\n\nOne thing I don't like about the card is the order of the three output connectors. To take the card in and out of a slot I have to remove the top screw \"post\". I don't know the technical term. The top connector is VGA, middle is HDMI and bottom is DVI. As is common for VGA connectors, when you plug in the connector there are two extended screws to hold the connector in place. Those screws fit into matching threaded \"posts\" above and below the VGA connector. On this one the top \"post\" is so near the top of the slot at the back of the PC that I have to remove the post to install or remove the board. If they had put the HDMI connector on top it wouldn't be a problem. (They may have put the VGA at the top so the card could fit in a low profile slot.)\n\nI don't do gaming or video editing, but the card is a great value and works for all the other things folks normally use a PC for. It runs well with either 32-bit Win 7 Home or Win 8.1 Pro.\n\nAlthough I basically haven't used AMD's Catalyst Control Center (which *is* installed), I do like the fact that it allows detailed control of all sorts of attributes, such as GPU scaling, color temperature control, etc."}, {"title": "It won't win any power contests, but it drives two monitors for cheap.", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2015", "text": "It's a pretty decent card for the price. I picked this up for my workplace computer. We recently got some new workstations that are form-factor Dell Optiplex machines that replaced our old mini-ATX tower computers. My old setup had integrated graphics that would run two monitors and I immediately missed that functionality with the new Dell. So, I went searching Amazon for the cheapest dual-output graphics card I could find. In short time I came across this XFX card. I've always had good luck with AMD/ATi in the past but this is my first experience with an XFX-branded card. I like that it came with two brackets to mount both outputs in low-pro mode. The screw hole that holds the HDMI output on the bracket didn't line up properly, but no biggie. It did not come with any mounting screws, I had to rob some from an old case (the new case didn't have any pre-installed). My only complaint is the ribbon cable holding the VGA output on is pretty short. My install situation forced me to put the VGA on top of the DVI and that stretched the ribbon to it's absolute limit. A little more slack would be nice for situations like mine. Otherwise it's a nice card - I'm not using for gaming, I just wanted two outputs on one card for as little money as possible.

Well this coupled with the PCI Express PCI-E 1X to 16X Slot Riser Card Flat Flexible Extension Cable (wire 19cm,total 24cm) , some minor case and wiring modifications, it worked perfectly. The XFX says that it required a power supply upgrade, but seems ok after 4 hours of gameplay. I had to splice into the +12v wires that go to the dvd burner, in addition to adding a +12v fan into the same splice to help cool the card. The software says that the card is running at 36 deg. C. The case modifications include splitting the card into two sections, with the included brackets: (A) the VGA output, the other (B) the DVI/HDMI output. (The entire thing together wouldn't fit into the PCI slots in the case, due to the clearance of the VC and riser plug into the bottom.) The section with the DVI/HDMI is too short, so I formed a straight piece of steel 1\" x 1/4\" that goes under the card, and pulls it forward toward the back of case. I then drilled/screwed this into place. If anyone ever tries this, you will see what I mean.

I replaced this for a 1050ti and holy crap did it feel alot more snappy. With the 1050ti i could run 144hz but with this one i can only run 60hz. I sold the 1050ti and switched back to this one in the meantime so i could still do my stuff on my pc but when i tried to play my games it ran horribly. Also, it makes my monitors colors look idk more gray, i have a Asus vg279q so it has good colors and 144hz but this gpu just takes that all away. I ran fortnite on performance mode and at 50% 3d resolution and it ran at barely 60fps. Then i tried Forza Horizon 4 and i got 15 fps MAX so yeah pretty bad. I overclocked it so now it runs 25 fps in FH4 so better but not great, and i can only put the 3d resolution up to 60% now with the overclock. After the overclock the screen started artifacting (black spots and lines on the screen) while gaming but it didnt bother me so i kept it like that. So to conclude, its not the best card for gaming and you'd be better off with integrated graphics, that being said if your pc doesnt have a IGPU i would get this card assuming its only for work and you just need to have a image on screen.

At completely stock settings the 1080, like all newer GTX cards, is designed to be silent THEN powerful. As a result, by design it ramps up to 83c and starts to dynamically throttle. It's nothing a custom fan profile can't fix, but the custom cooler cards [like Asus Strix 1080] are going to run cooler, clock higher [and use significantly more wattage.. I wanna say the strix listed 300w vs 180 stock] But let's be real: you're looking at a $600 card, power consumption is probably NOT the biggest priority on your list here.\n\nSo how does she GAME? Well, I can't speak to the latest AAA titles because I'm not a fan. HOWEVER: I *CAN* say that my average FPS on a dell 34\" 3440 x 1440 2k monitor [which they now call 4k for some reason] with a GTX 780 was approximately 160-180 with everything maxed on Diablo 3. with the GTX 1080 on my new 27\" 3840x2160 LG UD68-p 4k screen [which they now call UHD for some reason] I'm clocking 180-200 FPS with everything maxed. Given the increase in pixel density I'd call that a decent increase in frames.\n\nI could continue to talk frames, but let's face it: there are TONS of professional reviews out there that probably have your game du jour benchmarked at 1080, 2k, and 4k against any setup of cards. You're going to look at this review and go \"why even bother\"? \"You don't need that horesepower, what was the point\"?\n\nAnd to you I'd say: Occulus and Vive aren't going to be sold out forever. The 780ti would PROBABLY have worked, but I wanted guarantees, not wing-and-prayer hopes. 8 gig DDR5x takes Video ram completely out of the equasion for 4k resolutions [probably overkill still for a long time, but who knows, I can always grab another 34\" LG and run surround with 4k in the middle]\n\nUltimately I bought this card because I wanted it and I was at the right place at the right time to score one on launch day. To reiterate I WOULD NOT PAY MORE THAN $699 LIST FOR ANY FOUNDER'S EDITION OF THIS CARD! In a few weeks the scalpers should die out, and prices should return to normal, so just wait.\n\n\"But, you haven't told us if it's WORTH it\". Semi subjective, if you've already got a GTX 980ti or two I probably wouldn't bother just yet [wait for the 1080ti] but my system is quieter under load/gaming, significantly more FPS pushing more pixels. . . I'm happy with my purchase. Eventually I'll probably put an evga GPU cooler on it and start cranking things up [another thing to keep in mind, I've READ that the founders edition can be voltage limited, but if you're into heavy GPU overclocking you're probably already aware]\n\nUltimately your best option is to wait for the aftermarket cooled solutions, but if you're in need of a card like this and just \"happen\" to find one at the shelf of your local retail or e-tail store for the $699 MSRP. . .don't hesitate: She's still [probably] faster than you need"}, {"title": "WARNING DECEPTIVE ADVERTIZING", "rating": "1", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2021", "text": "The product is being advertised as a nvidia 1080 graphics card with pricing on par with a 1080. they are not selling a 1080, they state in the product info that it is actually a 1070 with the id numbers of a 1080. 1070s sell for half the listed price!"}]}, {"label": "MSI Gaming Radeon RX 5600 XT Boost Clock: 1620 MHz 192-bit 6GB GDDR6 DP/HDMI Dual Torx 3.0 Fans Freesync DirectX 12 Ready Graphics Card (RX 5600 XT GAMING MX)", "price": "624.00", "description": "Great gaming experiences are created by bending the rules.

Finally AMD released a new driver update mid March version 20.3.1 which seemed to fix the black screens and also addressed the known issues in the \"What's new\" portion of the driver update info.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is a 1080p killing machine!

Make sure it fits in your case before you buy it.\n2. Most RX 5600 XT's only need one 8-pin power connector, but this one needs two for some reason. Also, it needs the 7th and 8th pins to be connected, so plugging a 6-pin connector directly into it won't work even though it fits.

The listed clock speed is about 200mhz lower than the original cards which, at best, points to these being faulty cards flashed with a different BIOS to operate at a lower clock speed. HD 5770s and 6770s (same card with 2 names) also NEVER came with 4GB of VRAM.\n\nAgain, this points to this being a card with a fake BIOS. I've tested another faked GPU claiming to be a GTX 960 4GB and the card even reported itself as such to the computer. In actuality it was a GT640 with 1GB of VRAM. When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash.

In fact, the sealed PNY box included the video card and not so much as a single sheet of paper with quick install instructions or a driver disk or anything. It literally was a video card in a protective plastic clamshell within the box and there was absolutely nothing else in the box. It isn't worth me sending it back for them to simply send me another with no bracket so I have ordered a low profile bracket from a 3rd party for around $7 that will hopefully fit. This increases the price to $79 which is still around $5 less than the next least expensive gt 1030 that I could find. I definitely find the situation irritating that the description is incorrect.\n\nAs for the card itself, I removed the large bracket and went ahead and installed it in my preowned Dell Optiplex 790. It does fit in the small form factor with no issues and will be fully secured once I receive the proper low profile bracket.\n\nThe PC I installed this video card on has an old i5-2400 processor and 8gb of ddr3 1333 ram installed. I installed Windows 10 and Tomb Raider (2013) from my Steam library. Prior to installing the video card,\non low settings at 1080p, the Tomb Raider benchmark reported an average FPS of 6. That isn't a typo. The onboard graphics were terrible. After installing the PNY GT 1030 V5, on normal settings at 1080p the benchmark is a rock-solid 60fps. This isn't a powerful gaming card, but it is a fairly economic replacement for onboard graphics on older machines. My primary gaming pc has a gtx 1050ti which is a much better low end gaming option, but for an ultra low budget build it is a competent card for light gaming needs. I tested it for a couple of hours playing the Witcher 3 and it was able to handle the game without any hitching or stutters.\n\nWith this card you should be able to play most modern games and have a reasonably good experience, but you won't typically be able to use max settings and you may need to adjust some settings per game in the Nvidia control panel. Make sure you download the Geforce Experience application onto your PC and use it to download and install your driver, since the box doesn't include any software.\n\nFor $72 this little card is more capable than I was expecting and it definitely provides a good value for the price.

So in the overclock utility it is set to 100% but the second fan over the VRM won't kick on till its actually needed past a temperature of 60C even if you set fan speeds to 100% in MSI afterburner it only controls the fan over the GPU heat sink. Right now I have it overclocked @ 1500 MHz and the memory overclocked to an effective speed of 8000 MHZ although this is not necessary for other users its nice to know it can hit that reliably and stay stable in games. It's \"military class\" components and awesome cooling design definitely help there. This card takes voltage like no one else it is incredibly easy to overclock to 1500 MHZ(200-300 MHZ over stock boost) using simple YouTube guides and get a 1000 MHz increase memory overclock. It seriously increases the longevity of this card for future gaming, it hits well above 85 FPS in most games, that aren't capped of course, on very high and ultra settings. Also with good case ventilation I haven't seen this card go past 60 C once while overclocked! At idle depending on ambient temps its stayed between 26C-30C\n\nStock:\nStock this card still shines bright. I have found no AA or AAA title this card doesn't excel with, in no game I have played has it gone lower than 70-75 FPS except for where certain games are capped at 60 maximum, it is an amazing card that will last quite some time. Also important to note the card is dead silent and cool. It idles at near ambient temps at 25C and stayed between 45-55C in testing.\n\nSo in conclusion:\n\nPros:\nBeast of a card- can easily handle all games and future games for the next 2-3 years no problem on high, very high or ultra\nStays cool regardless of overclocking or not\nTakes overclocking like a champ\nHardcore components that allow overclocking longevity: HI C capacitors, solid capacitors and super ferrite chokes, mean it can take higher voltages and temps easily\nSuper Quiet!\n\nCons:\nLacks a back plate- would like to see a ventilated back plate to help with rigidity, this card is quite long and heavy and the pcb has the slightest bend to it-not detrimental but would like to see one for at least aesthetic appeal\nSize-You must have a decent size case for this card, luckily the Fractal Define S handles it no problem, it's quite large due to that awesome twin frozr cooler and the lengthy thick PCB to help with overclocking and heat dissipation\n\nReccomendations:\nMAKE SURE YOUR PSU HAS TWO 8 PIN PCI POWER CONNECTORS!!!!!-this card is factory overclocked and has some serious power requirements, I recommend at least a 80 PLUS Bronze or higher power supply with a 750 Watt rating, 500 watts as they recommend isn't enough headroom if you run a i5 like me or an i7.\nCase ventilation and size- this card is almost 11 inches long and 4.5-5 inches wide so make sure your case can accommodate it Also I recommend at least one intake fan with a filter pulling fresh cool air into the case towards the front of the GPU so it doesn't have to deal with higher case temps in the future.\n\nALL IN ALL: This card is worth the money if you are looking for a long term gaming GPU and is worth the $500 price tag, however if you have the extra +$180 at the time of this review and want something that will last even longer a 980 Ti from MSI would be a good choice, for me when I bought this card the 980ti came out like a week after purchase but this was so worth the money"}, {"title": "Excellent video card! Some caveats to be aware of.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2014", "text": "I bought this card around a month ago as an upgrade over the EVGA GTX 670 FTW Edition that I had before. It was during the period where 980s were in very short supply and there was a lot of price gouging by 3rd-party sellers and I managed to snag one of these from Amazon at retail price. This past month, I have had literally no problems with this card and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.\n\nPros:\nQuiet: the fans on this card completely turn off when the temperature is under 50 C (see note at the bottom). This results in silent normal operation but when the card gets hot, the fans turn on quickly and stabilize the temperature. But they are still no louder than my case fans and I can barely hear the GPU fans while gaming. Additionally, I have not noticed any coil whine that has troubled numerous other 980 and 970 models.\n\nCool: I have not seen the GPU temp exceed 67 C even while playing demanding games like BF4 and AC: Unity at maximum settings. The driver-operated fan manages to maintain this temperature at 50% speed, which is impressive, though the second fan is VBIOS-controlled and could be running at a different speed. Idle temp is around 32 C, which is pretty good for a card whose fans aren't even running at that temperature. The cooling solution is more effective than the blower fan on my old 670 by far.\n\nFast: This is one of the best-performing cards on the market at this time. Boost clocks are 1327 MHz on my card and it can handle everything I throw at it. I'm running BF4 at max graphics except for no antialiasing at 120% resolution scale and I normally get over 100 FPS. I can smoothly play AC: Unity at maximum graphics settings including TXAA without any stuttering or frame drops. Basically this thing can handle everything you can throw at it at 1080p without any problems.\n\nCons:\nPrice??? Not really a con, but $580 isn't cheap. But you get what you pay for and you're getting a lot.\n\nMSI Live Update: it doesn't work on my system. I can't get my VBIOS version information or any useful info out of this application.\n\nCaveats: not really cons, but things to be careful of.\n\nVBIOS: The default video card BIOS that came with my card had a bug where it would say the fan is running at 1% of its max speed even though the fan wasn't actually spinning. A video BIOS update from MSI fixed it, but as far as I know, this BIOS update has to be found on the MSI forum, not via its update utility. The new BIOS also seemed to tweak the fan profile; the fan now starts spinning when the temp reaches 50 C. I vaguely remember that the fan would start at 55 C using the old BIOS. Neither issue is actually problematic as the fans are so effective and they start properly, but it's something to keep in mind: VBIOS update beneficial.\nHOWEVER, if you plan to use the newer Nvidia drivers, you MUST update your bios as the newer drivers (after 344.16) don't work well with the old bios. This is a BIOS problem, so newer drivers require newer VBIOS.\n\nDrivers: I have heard that there are problems with the past few NVidia graphics drivers. I'm running an old version, 344.16, which most people say is stable and has been perfectly stable in my experience. I am using an HDMI connection and those with DisplayPort and UHD screens might have issues with this driver (these appear to be fixed in the latest beta driver 344.80).\n\nSize: Make sure you know how long this card is! I bought this card basically on a whim as it was the only one available at a reasonable price. This card is an inch longer than a standard card and might not fit into smaller cases. I was lucky and it just barely fits in my Zalman mid-tower case. Check the specs!\n\nTrivia: You get an MSI gaming mousepad along with the video card. It's a nice, large, stable mousepad with plenty of friction for precise mouse movements, but it has a strong plastic smell that fortunately dissipates with time.\n\nOverall I could not be happier with my purchase. This video card and the GPU within are great in every respect."}, {"title": "2022 Gaming PC", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2022", "text": "The 4GB VRAM is this card's only real limitation. I got it here for $325. It came wrapped in an anti static bag and several layers of bubble wrap. Looks and performs like a brand new card. Out performs a more expensive 1050ti because of the 256-bit memory bus and it overclocks easily with afterburner because of it's excellent cooling (with good case airflow.) I can play most modern titles at 1080p on medium or high settings and get decent frame rates. Textures and draw distance are limited by the 4 GB VRAM but in the current shortage it is just the ticket for a mid range gaming build. Paired with an i7 4790k, 16GB DDR 3, it's a great PC that will easily last to the end of the Win10 life cycle. Seller came through as promised."}, {"title": "Sexy.Sturdy.Silent", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2015", "text": "Ok this is amazing. PURELY AMAZING! So I myself haven't been able to use it in a computer I built yet, but My friend recently built a computer and I asked whether I could use his PC to test this card out and he agreed. He had a Z97-A and 4690K. Now on with the review:\n\nBuild Quality:\nThere was no sag, and the card felt sturdy and well built, I wish a backplate came included though. It was hard to mount in the S340 though, since the expansion slot and expansion slot holes were a bit hard to line up. It's not very long, which is good since MSI managed to fit amazing components and keep the PCB a size that would fit in most cases.\n\nAesthetics:\nI think this card looks like a boss, and believe it or not, its a bit customizable. Now some people think that you can only use this in red and black builds, but you can dismantle the fan shroud super easily by getting the screws out, and painting them whatever you want. I painted mine black and white, and it looked sexy. The LED is white, and its not too bright either. There's even a small engraving on the side of the card saying dragon army.\n\nNoise:\nThe MSI GTX 980 is extremely quiet. This is because during idle the fans spin off, and start to spin once the card gets to 60 degrees. I think its 60 degrees, might be a little less. However even when spinning, it's extremely quiet, no noticeable coil whine while running Folding@Home which puts both the CPU and GPU to 100 percent. While gaming and benchmarking it was also quiet.\n\nPerformance:\nObviously, it's a total beast. I was getting above 60 FPS on FurMark (Core),Unigine 4.0 (Extreme Preset), and GTA V with maxed out settings at 1080p Once I started overclocking it (on one wire delivering power so it could be more stable) i got 1520 mhz while barely raising the power target, but since there was one wire, i didn't want to risk stability. Overclocking depends on silicon lottery, and I got pretty lucky.\n\nConclusion: Would I buy it again? Yes. Do I think the 970 is bang for buck? No, because the price has dropped down to 500 bucks for this, and the R9 390 outperforms the 970. So I would say, this does bring more bang for buck compared to the 970. Sadly however, I do plan on selling this and getting a Zotac AMP! Extreme 980 Ti. However, I would recommend this variation of the 980 as it is a fantastic card that should last you a while."}, {"title": "Fantastic card.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2015", "text": "This is a fantastic card. Of course to run such a powerful card, it has to be coupled with equally powerful supporting hardware like CPU, RAM etc.\n\nThe performance output of this card is 100%. At least till now, i will see when the new-gen games of 2015 come out, but till now for the games of 2014, it's output is 100%, not a single loss of frame while running in High / Ultra settings. Apply V-Sync and you get a solid 60 FPS, lift it up and you go beyond 150 FPS, apply 4X MSAA and you get a minimum of 130-140 FPS on BF4, that's with all other settings to Ultra.\n\nNow comes the card's hardware, it is super quiet, while running the card at idle with 39-40 degrees temperature, i ducked down to look at the fans, they were at a complete stop. It's the new technology of Twin Frozr V design, the fans will only start spinning once the card heats up during load, after playing graphics intensive games like BF4 and Dragon Age Inquisition, i noticed the temperatures went upto 60-66 degrees which is totally normal.\n\nThe card is a little large, trust me if it looks like previous MSI GTX 600 or 700 series cards in videos or in pictures, it's larger in its actual self. I have a GZ-G1 Plus Gigabyte case, the case is big enough with very good ventilation, but i had to struggle installing the card, i had to tilt it to just get it into the case lol. But overall you won't be disappointed with the card.\n\nThings to note: It comes with two 8-pin power connector sockets, so make sure your PSU is at least having 8-pin power connectors or 6+2 pin power connectors. Avoid installing this card in a thin / small casing, you need a medium to large case to accommodate this card. Other things to note, it doesn't have a DVI-D display port, only a DVI-I among other HDMI and other display ports.\n\nIf your monitor doesn't have a DVI-I slot, don't worry your DVI-D cable will work fine with this card provided the maximum refresh rate of your monitor is 60Hz, just connect your monitor to this card using a DVI-D (Single or Dual Link) cable in case you don't have a DVI-I cable.\n\nBut if your monitor's refresh rate is 120Hz, you will definitely need a DVI-I or a DVI-D (Dual Link) cable, single link DVI-D cable won't be enough since the lesser pins can't transmit the required digital signals.\n\nBest of luck."}, {"title": "card is great, guys", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2014", "text": "card is great, guys. I totally forgot about the 0db fan thing, so I freaked out a bit. I ran heaven benchmark, and the second fan began to spin at 65c. The card stayed between 65c-68c throughout the rest of the benchmark which is awesome. In idle, I get around 35-37c when fans are not spinning :D! The only way to control both fans with a fan speed is to DL their VGA fan control app from their site. I haven't tried it yet because I have no need to. The oc mode, and gaming mode, etc works great. Just a click here, and a click there and it's all set-up. This is my first MSI card because I normally go for EVGA, but I liked the design, color, and overall awesome temp control this card has. I do not overclock, or adjust voltages so i do not have a say on how well this card overclocks, but at stock overclock it's awesome. I'm sure it has even greater O.C potential because of the awesome temperatures. Obviously max's all games out on the market, and I will be picking up another one very soon.\n\nAlso, MSI logo lights up white, the card is a bit thick because of the pipes, and has NO backplate. The PCB is black though, so the look with no back plate is not too bad.\n\n*Forgot to add, on the gaming app where you choose your OC mode, gaming mode, and silent mode, there is a \"cool down\" mode where fans spin at maximum speed to cool your GPU off even faster. It takes your high temp and brings it to idle temps within 40 seconds. You only do it every 5 minutes. I thought it was a cool feature :)\n\n****UPDATE 1-23-15: I have had this card close to three months now it still performs beautifully. I bought another and now have SLI configured. The only GRIPE I have with these cards is that one of the damn fans spin at 800rpm, on both cards, every 15-20secs and then stops. I have read into this issue and people say it is a BIOS problem and I will have to update the cards BIOS. I am not going to do that because I may brick the card, and my cards are working fine as is. People have also said that reverting back to a specific driver will make it stop as well. Now I am not sure who the culprit is here: NVIDIA or MSI. All I know is that updating the BIOS seems to cure the issue.

Well done Nvidia, and well done MSI. If you are considering any of the GTX 980's, I think the MSI Gaming is by far the best choice even though it lacks a backplate like the ASUS and EVGA cards. This card just screams quality and when you take it out of the box, you will gasp. It is perfection. I've been building computers for almost 20 years now, and I have to say this is probably the most amazing graphics card I've ever had.\n\nThe card certainly isn't cheap and is overkill for 80-90% of users out there, but for those that need, and want (and can afford) it, it is the card to get. The MSI Gaming GTX 980 is so quiet it's unbelievable. The Twin Frozr fans stay off until the card hits mid 60s(C), but MSI has a cool app called Independent Fan Control, on its website which lets you set the fan speed however you want. I personally prefer fans on at all times on a high end graphics card, so I keep mine running at 30% and they make NO noise at all. During gaming I set them to 50% (and you can set each fan to different speeds if you want), and they are still silent. Completely. Temps hover around 60-63C under full load.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any coil whine or fans issues like early 970-980s had either. They seem to have worked out all those probs now, and this card runs perfectly.\n\nI'm using the card on a ASUS PB278Q 1440p monitor and games look absolutely stunning in 1440p.\n\nThere are absolutely no cons for this card other than the price. If you can afford it and have a solid CPU, get one now. If you only game or use 1080p though, it's prob more than you need. I'm planning on getting a second ASUS 1440p monitor here shortly so we'll see how it does then, and I may even add a second one if needed.\n\nHighest marks MSI.

If you are running at 1080p resolution then you will be able to run everything at Ultra while this baby isn't even making a squeak of noise. The Twin Frozr V technology let's only one fan go to work under light load(lower temperatures) but the other fan will kick in once the temperatures start going up. I'm currently running a triple monitor setup(5760x1080p) and while I can't get 60FPS on most games on Ultra, I can still get a stable 30FPS. And to be quite honest, that is amazing considering I haven't even overclocked this baby yet. I do plan on purchasing another 980 in the future once the price starts to lower but if you are going for multi-monitor gameplay I would recommend getting two 970s instead of one 980. The performance will be better for 15% more cost. If you are running one monitor at up to 2k resolution then one of these should be no problem.\n\nPros:\nRuns extremely quiet when not gaming thanks to Twin Frozr V technology\n\nMSI Gaming app allows you to fine tune as well as use multiple presets for your graphics cards to customize performance over noise\n\nGreat design with LED MSI Logo(Yes this is a pro, it will look good with window cases\n\nDSR capability will allow you to render at higher resolutions thanks to downsampling.

Most cards that have an output layout like this are fake and, seeing reviews from people saying it won't run DX11, I'm inclined to believe this isn't even a 6770 as those did run DX11. The listed clock speed is about 200mhz lower than the original cards which, at best, points to these being faulty cards flashed with a different BIOS to operate at a lower clock speed. HD 5770s and 6770s (same card with 2 names) also NEVER came with 4GB of VRAM.\n\nAgain, this points to this being a card with a fake BIOS. I've tested another faked GPU claiming to be a GTX 960 4GB and the card even reported itself as such to the computer. In actuality it was a GT640 with 1GB of VRAM. When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash.

When it was time for an upgrade, I researched graphics cards at the price point I was interested in ($200-350). It was a choice between the GTX 1660 ti, the RTX 2060, and the GTX 1070 ti.\n\nI ended up choosing MSI's RTX 2060 Gaming Z edition, and I couldn't be happier. My main game on the PC is PUBG, and the GTX 1050 struggled real hard with it. I'd average 40-50 FPS, sometimes temporarily eclipsing 70-80. When I first installed the 2060, I had an issue with my monitor not picking up the signal. I was able to resolve the matter by resetting the bios on my motherboard. After that, everything ran smoothly.\n\nAfter updating the drivers to the 2060, I jumped into a game of PUBG just to see what the difference looked an felt like. The game had reset all of my graphics settings from very low to ultra, which I initially did not realize. I was getting consistent 100+ FPS. After some tweaking of the settings, I found I could average 90-100 FPS on high/ultra settings, or I can get a consistent 110-120 FPS with a combination of low/medium/high settings for various options.\n\nThis graphics card is amazing, it's a game changer. It puts out power close to that of a GTX 1080 for half the cost. I went with the 2060 over the GTX 1660 because the difference in price wasn't too great ($40-70 depending on which edition of the 2060 and 1660 you look at) and the 2060 has my PC ready for future technology in gaming. The GTX 1070 TI was just a little too expensive for a card that had a similar performance. Ultimately, I paid $40 extra to get the MSI Gaming Z edition mostly because the back plating was made out of metal instead of plastic, and I wasn't sure how I felt about having a plastic plate.\n\nNo regrets, I love this card. It's brought my PC which was struggling to keep up into a monster. No issues at all so far. I downloaded MSI Afterburner to monitor and possibly try some overclocking, and the GPU idles at 35-40 C. It's peaked so far at 68 C while gaming. The GPU has two fans with a factory setting to not turn on until the GPU reaches a certain temperature. This can be overridden by user controlled settings within the MSI Afterburner app.\n\nPC Specs:\nASRock A320M Pro-4\nAMD Ryzen 5 1400 Quad Core\nRTX 2060 MSI Gaming Z\n16 GB DDR4 RAM"}, {"title": "Does not come with a HDMI or Display Port cable.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2020", "text": "The description says \"Graphics card; cables and connectors; quick setup guide\". There were no \"cables and connectors\" included with the product that I received. There is also nothing on the MSI's product page that says it comes with cables. A bit misleading and cost me the purchase of a HDMI cable that I would have liked to have received at the same time the card was delivered so I could have used the card right away. (My prior setup used the old VGA connector so I didn't have a HDMI or Display Port cable.)\nOtherwise this graphics card is nice. I only play on 1080P so it's probably overkill but it is a RTX card and I might upgrade my monitor in the future to take advantage of the higher resolutions and features including of course G-Sync. FPS is high in most every game that I play with the settings up as high as they will go. It's a wonderful card and my motherboard has Mystic Light and they look great together. I highly recommend it. Just remember that you will need to purchase a HDMI or Display Port cable if you don't have one already.\n\nEdit: I finally got a new monitor. A nice 144Hz model with G-Sync. Fortunately it came with a Display Port cable because I didn't have one. While I would love to have one of the new RTX 3000 series cards this one works just fine for the games that I play and the ones that utilize DLSS and Ray Tracing look beautiful. I average about 40 FPS in 1440P in Microsoft Flight Simulator on the recommended settings (which hover in the upper medium range) and it plays smooth and the detail is nice. That's good enough for me and what I play! I like the subtle RGB lighting too. It doesn't overpower the other lighting in my PC annd the colors match even though my other lighting is a different brand.\n\nIt's kind of sad that if I wanted to I could probably sell this card right now for almost twice what I paid.

I wanted a more budget friendly GPU and didn't want to go with the 2070 0r 2080 due to the price hike and I'm glad I went with this for my first GPU. I haven't tried the RTX on it yet, so I can't say to much about that, but I will say for those that are looking to build a PC I would suggest they go with this GPU. Now, if the price is still a little high, I would suggest the GTX 1660, my brother and I used it for his build and besides that, everything else is the same.

It delivered well over 100fps. It's also a great looking card with some nice RGB installed.\n\nMy problem with the card stemmed from its noise levels and heat. Every time I booted up my computer, it ran very loud for about 5-10 seconds. Not too big of an issue but it got quite annoying. When I switched to the RX 5700 I found out that this graphics card was causing that loud noise. As I played more graphically demanding games I noticed that the graphics card was very hot when I touched the side of my PC. It wasn't an unstable kind of hot but it was enough to make me uncomfortable. Along with the heat came noise which over time became unbearable for me. I played with headphones but even then the constant ringing of my computer kept itching at me and made me uncomfortable. I'm indifferent on the $370 price tag, since I haven't experienced any other 2060 card.\n\nI personally would not recommend this. MSI makes good graphics cards but this one rubbed me the wrong way. I would instead recommend MSI's Mech Radeon RX 5700.

During the first month of having this card my computer would randomly freeze and I would have to restart. I put this towards it being a new build and Windows 10 defects (which there are many issues). Within a month of all the freezing and checks using all sorts of tools (making sure it wasn't windows), I started getting blue screens of all kinds.\nGetting annoyed I removed the card and tried to uninstall the drivers, well this just messed up everything and had to do a full Windows reinstall(2nd time). It removed other drivers that had nothing to do with graphics and wouldn't even allow manual installs of drivers. I am an IT Manager for a local company and am not completely ignorant to doing these types of things, for those of you who think I am being dumb about it. I even tried to put this in my other gaming PC and had the same blue screen and freezing issues.\nSo after my reboot and reinstall I contacted MSI about the issue. I filled out a RMA for them to repair/replace the item and after 3 weeks of NO updates or correspondence of any kind. I contacted them and they told me that the item has been through the repair process and should be shipped soon. I received an email the next day saying the item has been shipped, which raised some suspicion.\nThe card arrived 2 days later and I have had no issues with my computer for over a month(RMA+shipping+prep time and PC tests). SO, I KNOW there is no issues with my PC at this point and am excited to play some games with my RTX card. So I shut my PC down, unplugged everything to install my graphics card yet again. Boots up fine install the GeForce Experience stuff and get all the drivers downloaded everything is working fine. Go to start up a game and really test this puppy out and upon loading the game my computer freezes..... JUST LIKE BEFORE!!!! SUSPICIONS CONFIRMED!!!!!!!!! MSI NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT THE ITEM EVERYTHING IS THE SAME!!!!!!! I feel like they just had the item in a pile, assuming they didn't just misplace it, then I email to ask about my item and then they just said \"Eh, probably user error just send it back.\" Games freeze I can't even play one of my games because the game crashes withing 5 minutes of playing IF it doesn't crash on loading into the main screen.\nAt this point I don't even want a replacement I WANT MY MONEY BACK! I am going to write MSI a response to the RMA on the card and just request a refund.

This always happens when cards are originally released that people will buy them and then scalp for higher than retail. I was originally really upset that nVidia decided to make the 2080 at above the 1080 Ti release price and the 2080 Ti at the Titan Pascal price. What's the game changer is the TU102 chip, 11GB of GDDR6 VRAM in the 2080 Ti along with DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and ray tracing. This really is a professional card.\n\nI game at 1440p so the 1080 Ti was a great choice. I still love that card, but wanted to try the new features of the 2080 Ti. The price is silly, but the new hardware is no joke. There still are only a handful of games (and 3DMark) that use DLSS or ray tracing; I've only tried the benchmark in 3DMark, but ray tracing and DLSS really are amazing. Granted, 3DMark made a specific test to show this off (and nVidia has made a test for DLSS), but the reflections and lighting are incredible. nVidia wanted to get in the market before AMD to charge crazy prices so there really are few games that can use this new tech, but it will happen soon enough. I am bummed that the 2080 doesn't give much of a performance bump over the 1080 Ti because of the price. I had to shell out another $400 bucks to get about 30% better frames at 1440p.\n\nI've only had time to play Monster Hunter: World and Far Cry 5 with the new card. With the 1080 Ti I was getting 60-75 FPS on Monster Hunter and about 60-100 FPS on Far Cry 5. Monster Hunter hasn't gotten much better as I'm now getting about 60-90 FPS with the 2080 Ti, but Far Cry 5 has gone up to 90-144 FPS (144 Hz monitor). Monster Hunter World requires a serious amount of hardware, so I'm not too worried about the performance difference. I am excited to try Tomb Raider and Metro Exodus. I've seen from other reviews that turning on ray tracing decreases performance. The other HUGE thing is that because of the adoption rate of the 2080 and 2080 Ti, nVidia is releasing ray tracing on Pascal cards. They will probably take a fairly deep dip in performance since they don't have the same processing power as the 2080 and 2080 Ti, but at least nVidia is trying to give new software enhancements to people that can't afford the new flagship cards. DLSS can increase quality while also increase framerate when programmed correctly. The 1xxx series cards can't do that.\n\nYes the price is crazy, yes scalpers are getting extra money, but this card is the real deal. The only faster consumer card is the Titan RTX, but it goes for an incredible $2,500 with only about a 10% increase in FPS. You could SLI two 2080 Ti's for cheaper. I've heard the 2080 Ti can run most games in 4K at 60 FPS which is the holy grail of gaming. I tend to side with professional reviewers that framerate is more important that resolution which is why I have a 1440p monitor and not a 4K monitor. The other issue is getting a 4K monitor that can go over 60 FPS. There are only a handful of them out there and they cost at least a grand.\n\nIf you have the money, the 144Hz+ monitor, and the patience to wait for features to be released for new games, this is the best choice. If you're on a 900 series card and are running 1440p or 1080p, this card is overkill- go with the 2070 or 2080. It's ironic that 1080 Ti prices have climbed again so you're paying the same or more than for the 2080.\n\nI have quite a few fans in my case, so using the Precision X1 software, I'm able to keep the card at about 73 C using the auto fan curve feature. I can hear the card, but it's not any louder than my 1080 Ti Founder's Edition. Being able to change the LED is nice since I have a blue theme in my case. I've almost always gone with EVGA because their customer support is the best and they provide so many choices in cards. Even though there is the FTW3 and cards that are better cooled, I'm still able to get about 1800 MHz on the card just using the X1 software. I don't see a huge need to spend $100-300 more for that, but that's my opinion.\n\nEnough rambling. If you have the $ and want high resolution, high framerate goodness, buy this card.\n\nMachine Specs:\n\nMSi MEG z390 ACE Mobo\nIntel i7-9700k OC to 5 GHz with Corsair H80i V2 cooler\nEVGA 2080 Ti Black Edition\n16 GB Corsair RGB DDR4 3000 MHz\nSamsung 850 Pro SSD for OS\nSeagate SSHD 4 TB for games and storage\nEVGA SuperNOVA 1000 P2, 80+ PLATINUM 1000W PSU"}, {"title": "gaming at 4k", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2020", "text": "The two built in fan curves are just ok.

Cost was just under $1,000 to replace my MB, chip set and two HD. I included information on my system so you would know what the 2080 ti was running in. I've built 5 computers for family members and all 5 used Corsair carbide air 540.

It's been two days since I got the card, and it is performing really well. I'm OC'ing up to 1900mhz and 7700mhz memory clock, hitting only 71 degrees (60% fan speed on the card). I do have a big case with 7 fans working. It really seems that some cards have bad cooling, whereas others don't, so there is honestly no way of knowing whether the card is great in cooling unless you get your own. You can always return your card if you want, so I suggest you give a try. I have previously used 1080, and the card performance is as twice better. However, as a lot of people experience card failures usually within a month, I'm still testing the card.\n\nUPDATE:\nI've finally decided to return the card. I will give you the honest reason why you should not go for this card if you were actually considering getting 2080 Ti. But before that, I am assuming that you are getting this card because you want to get a high-end performing graphic card that every $ you spent is worth at least up to your expectation.\n\nStraight to this assumption, with this 2080 Ti card, you need to compromise. That was the reason why I returned. Some of you may say \"oh I just want whatever 2080 Ti that can actually perform 10% less than the $1.5k 2080 Ti card.\" Then, yeah you should definitely go for it, but you will constantly have to compromise with your card in terms of benchmarking, OC setting etc. My logic was that if I were to actually spend over $1,000 (close to $1.2k atm), which is already over-priced, why do I even need to compromise? I am already spending a ton, yet I need to constantly compromise for memory clock and gpu clock due to temp and power usage? To me, if I were to pay a ton of money for this kind of card, I want to be fully satisfied with the card.\n\nFor your reference, I overclocked 700+ memory, 200+ gpu, and 100 voltage with 112% power. The temperature stayed at 71 at max. However, I kept getting artifacts and BSOD because the card is rated pretty low compared to other 2080 Ti cards. Yes, the gpu goes all the way up to 2050 mhz. Is it stable? No. I mean stable as for all games. A lot of games will give you trouble, so you need to \"compromise.\" See, this was the reason why I didn't feel owning this card.\n\nNow, I'm owning 2080 Ti FTW3 by EVGA. Am I satisfied after spending $1.5k instead of $1.2k? Yes, because the card handles every game with constant 2050 mhz with more than 700 mhz memory clock. It's barely capped by power usage as well. I consider this value of \"not compromising\" more than $300, so it was worth switching.\n\nMy conclusion is this; the current pricing for 1080 Ti is close to 2080 Ti black edition; if you want to run 2080 Ti at factory default, go ahead and get this one, because it will perform better than 1080 Ti OC. If you want actual 2080 Ti? DO NOT GET THIS, because as much as this card is legit 2080 Ti, you will always be compromising. And btw, for the whole RTX issue, you are not gonna run into such a problem anymore. Even if you get it, which is hardly 1/1000 odd, register your card with the manufacturer and get a new one."}, {"title": "Amazing Graphics Card!

It can run every game ultra settings on 1440p. It can also run almost all games high settings on 4k. If you are gaming on 1080p or 1440p, You don\u2019t need to turn on the fans, because the card can easily handle these resolutions, which makes it extremely silent. While gaming on higher resolution and higher settings, you still might not need the fans on that high, but if it makes you comfortable, go for it! On the EVGA Software, you can pick the speed of the fans, if you put anything under 40% speed it\u2019s practically silent, and it cools the gpu very well. Even for heavy gaming, there is no reason to take the fans to over 60% because 60% speed with these 3 fans and big heatsink, cools the card just fine. However, this card is extremely expensive right now, and won\u2019t fit most people\u2019s budget. Any card really won\u2019t fit your budget currently.

The initial build had a nasty habit of rebooting randomly so I ended up RMA'ing the power supply thinking that was the issue. After swapping to a different case and changing up a lot of the layout of the computer I got it to reboot much less frequently.\n\nOnly in certain games would I have this problem so I kind of just avoided those games and played other things. Well about 2 months ago I decided to do more research in to the issue. Eventually I found a forum post on the Linus Tech Tips website saying that there could be a bad application of thermal paste on the GPU. So I tore my card down and lo and behold the application was pretty bad. I will attach photos of this. I reapplied with some Arctic Silver and put it all back together.\n\nMy rebooting issue is much better now! However, this has allowed me to see some other flaws in this card that are hopefully not my own doing.\n\nWhile recently playing the New World Beta, it defaulted me to 2560x1440 Very High settings (as it should with my current setup). As a note my FPS is locked at 60FPS, I don't see any reason to have my card work any harder than I personally need it to. I quickly noticed how much heat was being pumped out of my machine and the fan noise on this card was highly obnoxious. So I ended up turning everything down to low. Still having intense fan speed I resorted to turning down to 1080p locked at 60fps.\n\nOut of curiosity I bumped it all back up to where it was and took off frame limits. I was at 70FPS.\n\nI repeat, a 2080Ti and R9 3950X was at 70FPS in New World. Even with the reapplication of thermal paste I feel like there has to be something wrong. This card should be capable of way better than that.\n\nI am planning on purchasing a fan hub for my computer to fully ensure my computer is cooled as well as I can get it, so if I see that resolving the issue I will update my review. Otherwise, it has been a bit of a problem child, especially for the cost. I am just glad that I purchased this before the prices inflated to the point that they are now.

That got me looking for what could be the problem (This is a brand new rig I just put together, so it could have been anything at that point.).

So after selling off my EVGA GTX 980Ti with a EK water block my plan was to purchase a gaming laptop and wait for the new PowerColor RED DEVIL Radeon RX 480. I was going to plan and grab two since the price were low on those cards but I kept going to the ZOTAC site looking at those GTX 1070 cards. The beautiful craftsmanship, the size of the cooler, the dual 8-pin connectors and the RGB lighting. Made this card a winner in my book, everything that I wanted was on this card. Worried as I never purchase a ZOTAC graphic card before or let along anything form them. I was hopping I didn't made a big mistake on my purchase and I tell you what. I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, I did my order on July 22, 2016 and card was here that Monday of the 25th. What I liked about the card was the massive cooler that it had plus the dual 8 pin power connectors. Owning a Thermaltake Core X9 case i needed to make sure that I had a massive side card to make it look like it belongs there. Not only that I needed to be air cool so the cooler was important as the case normally ran everything water cooled. But I wanted to see how well a kid of that size did on a case like I have right now. In the past I had issues with massive card not being able to get enough air to stay cooled making them to loud and hot. I didn't wanted to repeat that mistake but this time I have a huge case that should provide enough air flow to cool not only one but two of these cards.\n\nSo far I like how this card sits on my ASUS Sabertooth X99 motherboard and as you plug this card in. It will be flushed with the shielding of the motherboard but no fair. You can still remove the card by going on the back-plate side and pushing the lever that hold the card in place down and you can safely and easy remove it. The card RGB are amazing too and specially when you have a case like mine you get to enjoy the beauty of those fans and RGB lights on the card.\n\nSo after running it for a while I decided to test multiple games on it to see how they all perform with ultra to epic settings. Note EPIC settings emulates 4K graphhics. You can see that in games such as Overwatch from Blizzard. As Far as the game titles use to test this card here is a list of them.\n\n-Game List- (Test done @ 1080p - 60Hz) LCD LED IPS 25\" monitor\nBattlefield 1 (NEW) tested game with all settings Maxed.\nAlien: Isolation\nARK: Survival Evolved\nBionic Commando\nDeus EX: Human Revolution\nDevil May Cry 4 Special Edition\nDiRT 3 Complete Edition\nHitman: Absolution\nLost Planet 3\nOverwatch - (Epic Settings emulated 4K)\nRemember Me\nRocksmith 2014\nStreet Fighter V\nStrider\nTomb Raider\nWorld of Warcraft\n\nPros:\n* A very powerful graphic card\n* Quiet graphic card\n* Amazing software tools, and RGB features\n* Huge cooler 3 fans design\n* Dual 8-pin power connectors\n* Some overclocking can put this card near if not right there with the GTX 1080.\n\nCons:\n* To heavy for some motherboard if not secured right.\n* To long for some cases so make sure you measure your case prior to buying this card.\n* Some people may not like the yellow theme on the back of the card if they are working on a theme that may not require to have yellow.\n\n-System Spec-\nCPU: Intel 5820k 6-Core (OC 4.5Ghz)-----|RAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX (4x4gb) ddr4-3000Mhz\nMOBO:ASUS Sabertooth X99----------------|FANS: 4x Nidec Servo GentleTyphoon 120mm 2150 RPM PWM\nSSD: 240GB PNY XLR8 -----------------------|VIDEO: ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1070 AMP!

It is amazing how cool it stays even during some of my games it will not spin the fans until it gets hot enough. Has worked perfectly with no drivers issues at all and has ran everything I put to it. The card is extremely quiet during heavy loads and can't say that about previous cards i have owned. Also I wrote to ZOTAC asking them some questions about warranty etc.... and they got to me very fast and with my answers. Very helpful and friendliness. I am pretty happy so far with the support, company and product.\n\n-Update 8-22-2016-\n*The card is still running great, new changes on the case I added water cooling to the CPU to try limit the amount of heat being pushed into the case. It seems to help with keeping the card at even lower temps during intense gaming. Not only that I overclocked the CPU to 4.5Ghz @ 1.28v and it seems to be helping the card run even better with higher overclocking settings. Once I find a better overclock spot for the graphic card I will post the results.\n\n-Update 12-16-2016-\n*The card was sold since I took the entire system apart, last performance update the card broke 2.1Ghz+ on air with the new NVIDIA drivers. Is like new performance was unlocked from it. Temps were within 49C-52C in a room temp of 72F. No crashes during gaming or artifacts at all. Sadly the card needed to be sold, now the lucky person that owns it can push it. =) Thanks and Good Luck to all."}, {"title": "Installation was very easy. Many people have commented on how heavy this ...", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2016", "text": "This review is for the ZOTAC GTX 1070 AMP! Edition.\n\nThe dimensions in the product description are incorrect. The correct length of this 2 fan card is closer to 11 3/4 inches. My mid-tower case, a 9 yr old Tagan CS-A Curbic, is 18.9\" long ( the length that matters in relation to the card length ) and only has 12\" from the back of the case to the HDD cages, allowing me to use this card but it's rather a tight fit with only about 1/4 to 1/2 inches to spare. If you are planning on getting this card or the AMP EXTREME ( a longer 3 fan card ) be advised to check your case layout before ordering. The outside case dimension is going to need to be around 19\"+ unless you have a case specifically designed for newer full size graphics cards ( ie cases from the last 2 yrs or newer ) or have drive cages that can be removed or moved around. Most new cases have listing for the maximum graphic card length.\n\nI'm very impressed with this card so far only having it 3 days. Installation was very easy. Many people have commented on how heavy this card is and thought it may damage their motherboards. My experience is if you have a full size ATX MB ( mother board ), and use the correct layout and maximum number of MB stand offs, sag shouldn't be an issue. My old graphics card HIS RADEON HD 4890 was 2 inches shorter but had the power connectors on the end of the card adding 2\" to the card length. This new AMP! card has the power connectors on the top of the card, so you may also want to check your case width to make sure it will fit. Sorry I didn't measure the height of the card so I'm not sure if the listing here is correct, Amazon shows 4.3\" but NewEgg shows 5.83\". It's close to 5\" if I remember correctly. My case is 7.6\" wide and I didn't have an issue with the power connectors hitting my 180 mm side case fan. The card requires 2 8 pin power connectors, but it includes 2 adapters for 6 pin connectors. In my case I had dual 4890s in Xfire so I had 4 of the 6 pin connectors to use, so you will need either 4 of the 6 pin, 2 of the 8 pin, or a 8 pin and 2 6 pin connectors; hopefully on different power supply rails. Also as a side note I'd suggest plugging in the power connectors before putting the card into the PCI-E slot. If you put the card in first it requires a good bit of force to plug in the connectors, which are on the part of the graphics card that extends past the edge of the MB and isn't supported. If you have a Micro-ATX board or don't have enough mother board stand offs you may damage your mother board if you insert the card before plugging in the power connectors !\n\nYou don't need to use the installation DVD, you can get the drivers and Firestorm software off the website. Someone already mentioned you want the FireStorm_V2.0.0.006E not the Chinese FireStorm_V2.0.0.009C which is the first one listed; scroll down to the correct version. The temperatures of the card are very good. I'm using the default clock and memory speeds. My room temp is 72 F, or 22-23 C and the card idles at desktop at 29-32 C. From what I've been able to read off the internet, idle temps of under 40 C are recommended, and closer to 30 C is better. Temps will be based off ambient room temperature, and in my case are 10 C higher than room temperature. The \"auto\" temperature control may or may not be able to keep the card under 40 C depending on the cooling properties of your case, since it keeps the fans off until higher temperatures are reached. Using the Firestorm app, I went to settings and checked launch at windows startup option. Then I clicked on the advance button for fan control, to set a fan profile on the user define setting window. I changed the default graph and set the graph to 10% fan speed for temperatures of 40 C or less, and left the graph the same for over 40 C. This has the fan set to 10% while on the desktop and keeps my temps at 30 C, and as soon as I start a game it goes to 50% fan speed and adjusts up as temperatures increase. The most demanding game I have is GTA 5. I used nVIDIA GeForce experience software to set the games optimal settings and I'm running at 1920 x 1080. Using a VERY old, ie. 2009, I-5 750 processor I get 60 - 80 FPS, much more enjoyable than my 30 FPS with much lower settings with my old 4890's. The card stays between 40 to 52 C which keeps the fans at about 50% speed. I can't say how quiet the fans are since my case fans make more noise than the AMP! does at 100% fan. The Firestorm app worked well to change the lighting effects, and since my case doesn't have a side window I simply set the STATIC LOGO to off.\n\nAs far as over clocking goes, I can't really comment since I don't require it. All the games I have I run at 1920 x 1080 and frame rates are from 60 to 300 FPS, ie. Diablo 3, CIV 5, etc. If you are going to run at 1080 resolution, I don't think you are going to need over clocking on any current games to get playable frame rates. Some games, like GTA 5 are more CPU intensive, so if you use an extremely old CPU like mine you can still play games at 60 FPS+, just know the CPU will slow them down. All the reviews I've read say it's pretty much the same at 1440 resolution if you have a newer generation I-5 or better CPU. If you are going 4K you need a GTX 1080.\n\nI hope this review helps if you wondered about card length, MB sage, or temperatures. If I have anything else to report later I'll do an update."}, {"title": "Updated: Recieved A Faulty Unit / GoW4 Promo Shutdown?", "rating": "3", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2016", "text": "Update - 3/5:\nOddly enough I've seen a decline in performance since I received my replacement card. The boosted core clock speed out of the box won't reach the same speeds even while put under the same tests now, and there's inconsistency while running games, one moment everything is fine and then the framerate will just drop. I haven't even been pushing the card, for the most part I've been playing a few games such as Depth, Team Fortress 2, Minecraft, and Vermintide at 2560x1080. I have completely removed my drivers before performing an install of Nvidia's latest drivers and no luck. I also monitor temperatures regularly and every checks out. I have also tinkered with Rivatuner to see if capping my framerate would help, no luck there either.\nI'm curious to know if the issues I'm having are a result of my card having Micron memory, and if it is, why doesn't Zotac have a BIOS update available? Other brands have released them to fix the issue.\n\nNote: I've begun to notice some substantial coil whine while playing games like Dead Island Remaster.\n\nI'll tinker some more and take a look around. If I end up figuring out what's causing my issue or find that I have to RMA my card, I'll be sure to update my review again.\n\nUpdated Review - 4/5:\nI had received my replacement yesterday and so far, so good! So far, VR games are running better on this than they were on my GTX 760s, DOOM runs great on Ultra/Nightmare at 2560x1080, and I can say Killing Floor 2 is easily maxed out at that same resolution! I'll write up more once I get to test it some more!\n\nNote: This is the first time I think I'm actually angry with Amazon. I can't be upset with them over receiving a faulty product, as things happen and it's not their fault, however, the fact their support won't make any comment in reply to my attempts to reach out to them about the GoW4 promotion is not only frustrating but also upsetting. I have also attempted to reach out to Nvidia and they were of no help, they clarified some things but didn't provide any actual assistance or hope. I have also reached out to Zotac, maybe they can help! *Fingers Crossed*\n\nUpdate: Unfortunately Zotac wasn't helpful. :(\n\nOriginal Review - 2/5:\nFirst off, I'll just say if I do decide upon a replacement and receive one that works I'll certainly update my review. From specs to aesthetics the AMP! Extreme edition card is beautiful!\n\nHowever, the beautiful aesthetics and performance were buried by hours of troubleshooting with no success... I purchased this as I intended to upgrade from my dual GTX 760s so that I could begin my journey into realm of VR and enjoy those pesky games what held me back before. Well, the hype was cut short as the unit I had received doesn't want to cooperate in the slightest. One second it's causing my monitor to flicker as if it were a light fixture at a rave party, the next second it appears to be working fine and then locks Windows down to a complete halt. Sometimes I can get into a game but the second I either close out or alt-tab the system locks up! It was extremely frustrating.\nAfter plenty of troubleshooting, I've come to the conclusion that I've received a faulty card. This is definitely a knocker as this is the first Zotac card I've purchased and it sets me back as I have to wait for a replacement if I decide to go that route and can't enjoy the beautiful HTC Vive sitting on my desk... (Edit: I connected my GTX 760s back up and I'm playing VR games with my Vive relatively fine with a few hitches here and there. The most noticeable graphical glitches popped up during H3VR, Nvidia's VR Funhouse, as well as The Lab.)\n\nOther Notes: The lighting on the card itself looks great, however, colors appear to be off. Yellow appears to be a lighter green, white appears to have a tint of blue, etc. while using Firestorm off of the included disc. Unfortunately, I hadn't the opportunity to see if the issue was resolved with a newer version of Firestorm as when I attempted to access Zotac's website earlier today it was down.\nDuring troubleshooting, I was able to start the Time Spy benchmark for a few minutes before a system lock-up. During that time, I noticed that the temperature and clock speeds were great while the card was doing its job. I was impressed until it locked up...\nIt's also a bummer that Amazon shafted people including myself in regards to the Gears of War 4 promotional code. Upon contacting their support about it, I have received generic emails back that have no correlation to the promotion."}, {"title": "Playing all my Games on 1080p Ultra max settings", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2018", "text": "Im running all my games on 1080P ultra max setting this card never gets over 60 degrees Celsius I haven't Overclocked it because there is no need only if I was running 4k I think but I haven't yet so i'm not to sure about that.\nsome games Ive ran so far\nPUBG- max setting 1080P ultra 70 to 110 fps 150 fps in some areas of the Map but its PUBG thats very Amazing Fps ask anyone!\nCOD ww2- max setting 1080P ultra 90 to 150 fps In game optimized mostly every thing is on Ultra nothing under High settings\nStar Wars Battlefront 2-max setting 1080P ultra 90 to 150 fps drops to 85 FPS in some areas buts still killer FPS\nFriday The 13-max setting 1080P ultra 60 to 80fps this game is very Graphics Demanding it gets in the 100s FPS in some areas of the map\nWorld of Warcraft-max setting 1080P ultra 60 to 100 fps \"New World legion\" drops to 60s in raids mostly stays in the 90s FPS range\nTekken 7- has fps in game locked on 60 but its on maxed setting 1080P ultra 60fps stabled\nIm sure this card would run any game on 1080p Ultra 60 fps or higher easy\nMy CPU is i5 7500 so if you have a better cpu you'll be doing way better then me in FPS Okay so any game before 2016 this card will crush it and 2017 games ill say most games will do better then 60 fps on 1080p Ultra settings\n\"New update\" This Card only uses 250 watts Max I have a EVGA 500 watt bronze Power supply its powering up my whole system I also Overclocked my GTX 1070 Amp Extreme and used 5 Bench marks My max temperature was 65 degrees Celsius I had MSI Kombustor running for 45 mins and right when I Closed Kombustor down the temperature instantly dropped back to temperature below 38 Celsius LOl so yeah these fans are very awesome they will get loud but NO game Will EVER stress your GPU to that level or get high Temperatures so your fans will never reach those's levels or loud sounds they are meant to run very fast and loud to keep your GPU from catching on fire. for the most part youll never ever hear them only if your running multiple programs down loading videos music or some other crazy things we do on the internet streaming while playing your games or what ever the fans don't get loud if your only playing the game or doing both streaming and gaming with music playing again THEY DONT GET LOUD if your only doing that, but if your doing extreme overloads that only bench marks and stress test do then YES. the fans do get loud so that your GPU wont catch on fire"}, {"title": "ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1070 AMP!

When the Air conditioner on and room temps @ around 24-25C the Card idles at around 26-27C @27% fan speed with the custom fan curve, Load temps running The Witcher 3 never exceeded 58C @48% fan speed, which I believe is outstanding !!\n- Out of the box Boost to 1976 MHZ While playing The Withcer 3\n\nCons:\n- A large and heavy Card, but you should already expect that if you're going with the Extreme, it's 2.5 slots width and might require you to remove the opposite HDD cage even in large cases as in my case (NZXT Phantom 530)\n- Due to the weight, it sags quite a bit, but that's probably OK !\n\nSystem Specs:\n- Gigabyte GA-Z170X-Gaming7 MotherBoard\n- Intel Skylake 6700K @stock with Cryorig H7 Cooler\n- G.skill TridentZ 3200Mhz DDR4 16GB RAM\n- EVGA 850GQ PSU\n- Acer XB271HU 1440P 165hz IPS G-Sync Monitor\n- NZXT Phantom 530 Case\n\nOther thoughts:\nAn amazing Card all in all, excellent cooling capacity, nice looks and great performance, would definitely recommend buying this card, even over a 1080 as it's the better price/performance rival !!"}, {"title": "Titan X performance for less than half the price?

Second, I didn't have the patience to save up for it. That's when this bad boy comes in. The GTX 1070 is a beast at $449 (or at least that's what they cost when I bought them, thanks 1080Ti). I originally had the 1070 ftw but bought 2 zotac founders cards because of sli. Every game I play with just one card card can be run at 4k max settings (except for anti aliasing), usually hovering around 60 if not going over, with some titles dipping into the mid 30s if you're in a really intensive part of a map or whatever, i.e project cars at night with rain and stuff. While this card can do 4k, 1440p is still the sweet spot for this beast. That was before overclocking. I don't know if my cards are golden (I say \"cards\" because I'm running 2 in sli) but to me +215 on the core and +500 on the already faster than usual gddr5 is pretty good. Speaking of sli, it's not a nightmare. It doesn't always work but when it does, it works very well (I'm using the sli hb bridge if it helps). Using pcars as a reference, at night with rain on circuit de 24 heures du mans with no other cars to eliminate cpu bottleneck, both cards in sli manage north of 100fps at 4k max settings except for anti aliasing and fxaa because 4k doesn't need that. That's impressive in my books. So performance is great, but what about the card itself? It's a high quality item and it knows it. The shroud is beautifully finished, with the illuminating GeForce logo reminding everyone that you're pro mlg, just as long as your case has a window. The backplate is also nicely done, and the patterns look cool. Half of the backplate is removable to allow better airflow in sli. I haven't removed the plate yet but I plan to. In fact, i ought to, the top card gets kind of toasty as my motherboard doesnt have pcie slot spacing that leaves room between the 2 cards. The card comes with a driver cd which is nice for first time installs, as well as installation of firestorm, zotac's overclocking utility. I personally prefer precision but firestorm isn't too far behind. It also comes with (I think 2) 2x6 pin to 8 pin connector(s?). Overall, the 1070 is amazing value, and the Zotac 1070 founders is a good version of this card.

I had an Nvidia Geforce 970 GTX SSC from EVGA and I had purchased that card earlier this year and it was also very good for what I did. I was upgrading my monitor to a 1440p and needed the extra horsepower that a new Nvidia 10 series card would provide. Boy was I estatic that I upgraded and purchased the 1070 GTX from Zotac. Normally I purchase almost exclusive EVGA products but after reading the reviews on this card and comparing its specs to similar cards offered from other manufactures I settled on Zotac. I can't speak enough on the build quality of the card, its hefty and feels luxurious in your hand, the carbon fiber accents are perfect. This card is perfect for 1440p and will do 4k in a pinch and absolutely demolish anything in 1080p with max settings.\n\nNot really a con but something to be aware of, the card itself is massive. I know that people have said that on the reviews but reading and seeing pictures do not do the card justice of seeing it in your hand. I compared my old EVGA 970 GTX to this and the Zotac 1070 GTX was easily about an inch and a half longer and it felt heavier as well. Be sure to utilize all the supports provided by the motherboard and you should be fine. I have a Corsair 600c case and I have plenty of room but just be aware and plan accordingly. I would also suggest going to Zotac's official site and downloading the software for controlling the lights on the card and fine tuning software instead of installing from the disk.\n\nI think I have found my new go to video card manufacture for whenever I need to upgrade cards.

Extreme is a very large video card. It's also a really solid preforming video card! After setting it up and preforming benchmarks it preforms better than any other 1070 I've worked with. It's ability to overclock is fantastic and it's size is due to the cooling system they have created. The size is both great and a slight problem. It will really sag in your case due to all the armor and the cooling system. On the other hand, it has all this nice armor and a beefy cooling system that allows you to run at temps lower than other 1070 cards on the market, especially when overclocked. I'm also a fan of the aesthetics. It might be over the top for some but I like it. Zotac ships it with their firestorm software which is fine for setting fans, clock and memory speeds.

It's not overclocked out of the box, but it doesn't need it. It's a monster and can handle the most extreme of games. There's room to overclock with the Alienware 330W PSU. It came with the Driver Disc, information card, and a PCIe 6x2 pin to 8 pin adapter. This card has a DVI-D (DL) port, one HDMI, and three DisplayPort connections. If you have a display that only supports VGA, you will need to get a DisplayPort to VGA adapter since DVI-D has no analog support.\n\nFor Alienware X51 R2 users, you will need to remove the front grill fan from the computer- you will not need it. Some cutting of the internal dust screen at the bottom of the computer case was needed to give room for the 8 pin PCIe power plug.

The 1050ti is a great GPU for budget gaming builds or when you have a limited power supply. There is no 6 or 8 pin power plug on this card, just plug it into the motherboard and you are done. This bothered me at first, I wasn't sure it would be getting enough power. But it turns out that wasn't an issue at all. This thing sips power, and if you run the Precision OC or MSI Afterburner software, you will see the GPU cruises at just a couple hundred mhz until it's needed for gaming, where it goes close to 1800mhz, and can be overclocked close to 2000 (but I just leave it at the default, it works great). Although this 1050ti SSC has a higher clock speed out of the box than the smaller base model 1050ti cards, if you want to do any extreme overclocking, you may have better results with the 1050ti FTW, which does have a power connector on the card and allows for a higher current draw.\n\nOverall, I had excellent results with some of my older games. CS:GO and Skyrim regular edition (no mods) ran at a steady 130-150fps at almost the highest settings, and by turning down things like shadow detail and reducing the anti aliasing, I was able to get the framerate very close to matching the 165hz of my Dell S2417DG monitor at 2560x1440 resolution! That is very impressive, but they are older games so high framerates are expected. I tried the new DOOM game, which is well optimized from what I understand. at 1080p settings, I was getting a steady 60fps on fairly high settings. The trick with this card is to know where to compromise. If you want Ultra quality at 4k with the newest games at a high frame rate in 2017, this card isn't for you. But with a couple video settings tweaks, you can really get some nice looking performance from this 1050ti SSC.\n\nAs of the time of this review, 1060 and 1070 GPUs are still greatly overpriced, and the jump to a GTX 1080 is pretty steep if you are trying to build a \"budget\" gaming PC. Once 1060 prices come back down to earth, that may be a better option, but for now I have been very impressed with the 1050ti. For 1080p gaming, I would recommend it for any budget build. I do want to note that I was using an i5-6600k (not overclocked) and I never saw my CPU pegged at 100% during these tests. If you decide to use something like a G4560 CPU (which is amazing for the price), you may not get quite the same performance on some games, depending on how CPU dependant they are. I apologize for not being able to test this card with a slower processor, all I had available was my Z170 motherboard and the i5-6600, and I'm also running 16gb G.SKILL 3000mhz ram and a Corsair gold rated 550w power supply. Fairly hefty specs, but as I mentioned earlier, I didn't want to pay double the price of this 1050ti for a GTX1060 6gb. This GPU gives great performance for the price, and I'm very impressed with it so far."}, {"title": "Awesome Video Card", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2017", "text": "Pros\nPrice\n4GB of DDR5 Dedicated Video RAM\nNicely Packaged\nIncredible Graphics\nQuiet (I got the single fan one)\n\nCons\nNot sure I found any but if you want dual monitors be prepared to use different cables for each monitor or I suppose purchase some sort of Y cable for either DVI, Display Port or HDMI port. This Card only has one connector for each of these cables which for me is not an issue.\n\nReview -\nI received this card two (2) days ago and I promptly installed it and test it. I work in IT so I didn't need to read the instructions but it comes with a Display Driver Disk, a little installation instruction manual, a quick start fold out sheet and a pretty fancy metal sticker. All documentation comes in English, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese and 3 different Asian languages (I am guessing they are Japanese, Korean and Chinese).\n\nI didn't have to change my power supply since mine is able to handle 450Watts but you should know you would need at least a 300Watts Power Supply. In fact, before you buy any Video Card you should go to the manufacturer and see what it requires and adjust accordingly (either buy a new Power Supply or buy a different card). However, I don't know any systems that carry a 250Watts Power Supply anymore all of them are either 300 or 350Watts and if you bought or built a Gaming Rig I'm sure you went insane with the Power and got the biggest thing you could afford.\n\nPCIE Connector and mine didn't require any additional power other than the one provided by the Motherboard which made swapping out cards extremely easy. I installed the Drivers provided by EVGA and then I launched my NVIDIA GEForce Experience and Updated the Driver to the latest (my previous card was also an NVIDIA card). It took me longer to unplug all the cables and break my computer open and put it all back than it did to install the card and the drivers.\n\nNoticeable improvement in Video on Games and Performance. I tested it against a recently purchased Game which is still in Beta (Star Citizen) which was very Jerky and requires a minimum of 2GB or RAM (I had just below 2GB at 1.7GB with my old one). Not only did it render it beautifully the performance improvement was evidently. I also test it with Mass Effect 2 (which my old card could handle easily) and the improvement in video detail was amazing (my wife who is not a gamer could tell the improvement immediately even though she's only seen the screen periodically here and there). I tested it against SWTOR and I increased all the Graphics settings to high (which was nice to see the effect) and it handled beautifully.\n\nI have not done any Arena style gaming yet so I cannot speak on its performance on PVP and Arena Style games. However, it handles fine in fights, zero lag or any issues that I have found.\n\nI am very happy with this purchase so far. I was fretting between the EVGA, MSI or GIGABYTE one and looked at all the overclocking specs until I went cross eyed. In the end I chose one that fit my budget below $160 and to be honest for the level of gaming I am doing (no VR obviously) it doesn't matter all the overclocking. The bottom line is 4GB of dedicated DDR5 RAM just for Video.\n\nIf you are fretting look at three things\n1. Get a card with minimum 128bit Memory Bus\n2. Get at least 4GB\n3. Price"}, {"title": "A very well balanced videocard.", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2019", "text": "What I like about the 1050Ti is that it strikes an excellent balance of things. It runs very cool and quiet while still performing excellently. You probably don't want to use this for anything like VR, but for normal ~1080p gaming or whatever it's great. It's extremely low power and very efficient, so your power bill won't go up just from playing games.\n\nBut there's not much point in reviewing a specific GPU since that's not a specific product but a range with variance. As for the actual product itself overall I'm fairly satisfied. I don't like flashy LEDs and such inside my computer so I wish it didn't do stuff like that, but it's overall not bright and not too bad (I still clipped the LEDs though.) One thing that annoys me about this entire range of eVGA products (eg 1060, 1080, etc etc) is a very odd choice they seem to have on the cooling: they turn the heatsink fins up and down instead of left and right. What this ultimately means is that the rear output is fake and pointless. All the heat from the videocard exhausts above and below it. That means some pools towards the bottom of the case to be recycled (unless you have one of those turbine fans mounted below taking up a slot) and some goes towards the CPU. Now, this is a pretty efficient line, so it doesn't put out a lot of heat (especially the 1050 -- even the Ti version) but how hard really would it have been to simply have the fins go left and right so at least some would exhaust out and the rest would be caught up in the normal fuller airflow? It's just a silly and pointless design mistake that shouldn't have been made even on these cooler cards since it wouldn't have cost anything extra simply to have the fins turn the other way. Since the fins turn the way they do it effectively blocks any air from actually going out that way.\n\nThe other thing that annoyed me was the connector choices. One DVI, one HDMI, and one DisplayPort (why?) I would rather two HDMI or two DVI than a DisplayPort connector, but I think the most optimal solution would have been to include an adapter. Unfortunately I end up with the wrong monitor as \"primary.\" It's fine within the OS itself, but the BIOS, bootup menus, initial setups, etc etc all end up on the wrong monitor. Given that the second half of the card is not _ACTUALLY_ a rear exhaust, they may as well have used that area to spread out the connectors more and maybe provide an extra along the way.\n\nNow, all that said, it's overall a good card. The fan is very good and quiet with plenty of CFM and the heatsink makes quite good contact. The general build quality feels pretty good and I think this card will last a good long time. Even with the LEDs it doesn't actually look bad (I've seen some very questionable design choices out there, so this can be a consideration even if one doesn't care much about looks.)"}, {"title": "Terrific Budget Card That Performs As Good As It Costs", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2017", "text": "SHIPPING AND PRICE:\nThe price is very reasonable for what you get out of the card in terms of performance (More about that later). It took around 2-3 weeks and $4-8 to get the card to me in Australia in the outer suburbs of Wollongong.\n\nINSTALLATION:\nThe installation was almost idiot proof, i use an Alienware X51 case since i have had this PC for over two years and have had no money to build my own PC at the time i got the PC (I was 13). It is has no need for power pin connectors, it only draws power from the PCI slot which, in my situation with the extremely small case is great. The only thing i needed to do was remove the black graphics holder so the card doesn't hang (Don't worry about that if you have another case, this is only a problem for us poor Alienware users ).\n\nThe next part was the part i have never had to do before since this is my first time upgrading my PC with something significant, the software installation. At first i tried playing games and the computer would just lag like hell in the games, after ten mins of confusion and thinking i realised i needed to insert the installation disk to put in the new software for the card, after around 10-30 mins of installing, it was ready to be gamed on. :)\n\nPERFORMANCE AND SOUND:\nIt is literally dead silent, my computer use to sound like a jet and now its a toned down jet (still a jet due to CPU cooler). Also the performance, for me at least was day and night (Coming from a crappy Dell GeForce GTX745).\n\nComing from barely running \"Next Car Game: Wreckfest\" with 20-30fps on low settings to all the way to 50-60fps on fully maxed out settings on 1080P (you could say it was a massive leap for me). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3rCE8Ivv4A&t=26s\n\nPlaying Unturned on Medium settings with 20-40 fps depending on many factors, now i can play it with settings maxed on 40-70 fps.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR2YLdTmvmU\n\nCounter Strike: Global Offensive use to run at around 40-70 fps on the \"Canals\" map and now runs perfectly at 120-150fps easily.\n\nOVERCLOCKING:\n(Your results may vary, every card has a different maximum OC )\nNow, i can already hear from my fellow #PCMASTERRACE \"Why OC a card that is already OC stock?\" well let me explain.\nComing from a graphics card that i got forced to push to the max to even play many games on low settings mainly, it is sort of a habit i have developed. Now, i can't help to brag but after testing out the games on stock without an OC, the card ended up being better then a FTW card when i overclocked it. Do i recommend overclocking this card? Yes, but when you are doing so, please do not tell the MSI or EVGA overclocker to use that OC on startup until you know that OC is stable enough. Also remember not all cards are made equally, someone out there could of pushed the card an extra 400Mhz but you can only do 140Mhz.\n\nCOOLING:\nThere is no debate about cooling, even in my case, with an OC, the card stays very cool no matter the situation.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIt is currently the best budget gaming card for this price point. The graphical power is the same or even a little more then what you paid for, it doesn't suck much power at all, doesn't require an power PIN connector and is dead silent. In my eyes i dont see any cons.\n\nWell.....\n\nMaybe one...\n\nWhere is the RGB lighting??"}, {"title": "Stand-in replacement for GT 620", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2017", "text": "So, I upgraded from a GT 620 to this GTX 1050 ti, making it my first game-grade card. This was also the first GPU I've ever installed, but I was able to do it without using a manual. In terms of difficulty, it's between RAM and HDD in difficulty but closer to RAM. The hardest part was researching the available cards.\n\nMy top reason for choosing this card is that it is the top-performing card that I was prettily sure would run on my current power supply and fit in my system. I'm using the same 300 W power supply that came with my rig and I have a core i5 (quad), two HDDs, a USB hub, and one monitor attached. I haven't noticed any increase in temperature or noise, and I haven't experienced any unexpected shutdowns. Since installing the card, however, I did notice that DWM (Desktop Window Manager) would occasionally become unresponsive in Windows 7, forcing me to forcefully restart the system, though I can't say with certainty that the card was the culprit or that it only happened after installing the card. Either way, since updating the GPU driver, the problem has never resurfaced.\n\nMy old GT 620 was somewhere between an Wii U and Xbox One in terms of power, while the 1050 is beyond the PS4 Pro. It's worth noting that NVidia states that this GPU does not support VR, though this was not a deal breaker for me. I found it interesting that some predecessors in the 900 series had VR support, but those cards also seemed to require external connectors, which was a deal breaker for me, since I planned to play console-style titles in the future. So, it looks like they had to sacrifice VR support for power consumption.\n\nOne of the best features of recent NVidia GPUs is Share (i.e. ShadowPlay), a feature which allows gamers to record and broadcast their gaming sessions. In the past I've tried using CamStudio to record gameplay, but it had some issues with flickering and recordings inexplicably stopping. Share addresses these problems and there is no noticeable hit to performance. Well, under Windows 7 there is a 4 GB file-size limit for video files, since Share uses Windows Media Foundation, but the nice thing about the recorder is that it will just create a new video file to continue recording. This does ultimately require long sessions to be stitched if you\u2019re planning to share your footage, but that can be done easily with any video editor. With desktop capture enabled, which is what I use, you can capture anything on screen, even non-games. The GUI for Share could be a somewhat more intuitive, but it mostly stays out of my way. I simply use Alt+F9 to start and stop recording. One important caveat of Share is that visual styles needs to be enabled for recording to work. Consequently, the emulator Gens cannot be recorded full screen because it disables visual styles when in full screen; it will, however, work if the emulator window is stretched to fill the screen.\n\nI am satisfied with my purchase. It's great being able to game at max settings."}, {"title": "The Card is Great!

Using Geforce software to tweak games always puts graphics too high. After several updates the Geforce software fails its updates and thus won't allow driver updates.\n\nI bought it for my Windows 7 64-bit desktop tower with quad-core CPU and 12 GB of RAM, to play Overwatch at medium to high graphics and it does its job pretty well. If I run on high graphics (sometimes on medium too) I do occasionally get a Windows prompt when I exit the game about the computer performing slowly and asking if I want to switch to the basic desktop window settings. I get a consistent 60-70 Frames-Per-Second (FPS) and despite the windows warnings I haven't seen any problems with performance. I get the warnings more often if I am also running a background app such as Discord (just an example, it's the only app I might actually want to run along with the game) in the background and so I tend to either exit that app when play or run the game on medium graphics when I need Discord. Although I still don't have any major problems when I do run them both at the same time. The main issue I have is with Nvidia drivers and Nvidia Geforce Experience software. They worked fine for a few months. I installed all the updates, driver and Geforce, but then all of the sudden the Geforce software just wouldn't update. I claims it has one, but when I got to update it just says the update failed. I uninstalled and reinstalled Geforce but it still won't update the software yet still keeps saying there's an update out there, and of course now there is a driver update which can only be installed through the Geforce app. Leaving me with no where to turn. I had this problem with my old Nvidia graphics card (except the driver updates would actually crash the computer and leave me booting into a black screen forcing me to revert to a restore point).

The only reason I rate it a 4, and not a 5, is that it is a far cry from the next level of AMD Vega 56, in terms of both technology and performance. This is 2+ year old tech being used as the highest mid-level performance, rather than new tech flowing down to the mid-level for better efficiency.

You've never created and enjoyed games like this before. Ray tracing is the definitive solution for lifelike lighting, reflections, and shadows, offering a level of realism far beyond what's possible using traditional rendering techniques. NVIDIA Turing is the first GPU capable of real-time ray tracing. GeForce RTX gaming GPUs come loaded with next-generation GDDR6 memory, support for DirectX 12 features, and more. This is graphics reinvented.", "rating": "4.4", "Reviews": [{"title": "Great RTX Card", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2018", "text": "(11/20/2018) I purchased the MSI RTX 2070 Gaming Z 8G. I took many factors and pricing based on what was available and compared to other cards. I was primarily looking for a card to replace my ASUS GTX 970 Turbo. With Battlefield 5 releasing and testing my setup (below) with the GTX 970, my settings could only handle 60 FPS with everything at medium. Battlefield 1, I was able to play at around 80 FPS with DX12 off, so it was definitely time to upgrade.\n\nMy Setup:\nCPU: Intel Core i7 7700k at 4.2 GHz\nRAM: 16 GB Vengance\nMotherboard: ASUS Strix B250G Gaming\nMonitor: ASUS MG278Q (2K res at 144 Hz)\n\nUpon receiving the card, the card is definitely bigger than the GTX 970 and heavier. Make sure you have enough room in your case as this card extends the micro ATX board setup. The card come with plates and can customize the RGB LED's.\n\nI chose this card as it was par with the RTX 2080 in cores and clock speeds, and even the GTX 1080. The downfall which many will know is that RAY tracing is not amazing with this card. I play all my games in 2k res at 144Hz and really only enjoy playing FPS at or above 60 FPS. Playing BF5 with ray tracing on (low) with everything at ultra had around 20 to 30 FPS average with sometimes reaching mid 50's. Once i reduced my graphics to high instead of ultra, FPS gains were up 10 to 20 FPS. With Ray tracing off and everything on ultra, I was getting anywhere between 80 to 130 FPS. Changing my res to 1080 with everything on ultra and even RAY tracing on ultra I had FPS above 60. The downfall to this was quality of the game graphics.\n\nAs of 12/13/2018, EA/Nvidia release patches that improved the FPS with RAY tracing, but only a gain of about 10 FPS. I still continue to play BF5 with RAY tracing off and everything on ultra. I did notice some hiccups where the game would freeze for a split of a millisecond, but it could be the game more than the card as BF5 is still buggy.\n\nAs of 4/4/2019 this card continues to perform perfectly with any game I throw at it. I currently have been playing anthem with above 50 FPS with the new ray tracing features and DLSS available in the game. There are some dips due to high fidelity and other high graphical areas within a battle area, which is why the lowest I have seen is 50 FPS. With Ray tracing turned off, i get above 70 FPS. While this card is big, I am hoping to replace the stock fan with a water loop system. On a micro ATX board, do not expect to utilize any of the PCI lanes besides the one for the GPU.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with this upgrade for the price. The 1080 ti stock is basically depleted or costs over $1000. The 2080 cards are better than the stock 2070 cards, but this msi card is par or better than the 2080 stock cards. Only advantage to the 2080 cards was more CUDA cores. This is my first msi card as well, since i usually go with EVGA or ASUS. EVGA unfortunately did not have any in stock during the time of my purchase."}, {"title": "Easy to install, made out of quality materials, software easy to use and overclock.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2019", "text": "Unboxing: Unboxing you get many papers; consisting of a Quickstart guide, a couple pieces of paper telling me how to register my GPU, a set of paper coasters (because MSI), the GPU itself inside of a very protective Styrofoam casing, along with a support bracket.\n\nInstallation: As I was replacing my old GTX 1070 ti, all I had to do was follow the, if somewhat cartoonish yet very helpful and straightforward installation guide. You need to undo the screws holding in the current GPU on the back of the case, then unclip the little buckle at the end of the PCIE express connector. Once that's done, you unplug the current GPU and remove it. Then, all you need to do is take your new GPU and push it from the back to the front until you hear a satisfying click. At which point you use the screws you took out at the beginning to screw it into place. Once this is done, you plug in the 6 and 8 pin connectors into the GPU. When you turn on the PC, it may start up with its default resolution, which for me, was this blurry 600 x 800. But once I went to Nvidia's driver page and installed the proper driver along with geforce experience, it was only a matter of time (no more than 20 minutes) to get the drivers installed and working perfectly. Once I got the drivers installed I just restarted by pc just incase. Once that was done, I installed MSI Afterburner to overclock. The best overclock I could get was 100mhz on both the core clock and memory, which was pretty good. It's important to note that I did not need to install the support bracket, so I can't say whether or not if it was easy to install.\n\nPerformance: The performance of this chip is much better than the GTX 1070 ti I was replacing, and rivals something like Nvidia's own GTX 1080. While I wasn't able to take full advantage of RTX ray tracing, I was able to fully max out Far Cry 5 on 2560 x 1080 and get 90+ frames with little to no fan noise. I also fully maxed out GTA V and, while it was a mixed bag of frame rates, I always stayed above 60 fps and never went beyond 75 degrees. Because of the massive heatsink on this GPU, the fans only speed up when the temperature is sustained at around 60+ degrees. The RGB lighting is pretty, but somewhat understated, and by no means should it be the deciding factor between this and another GPU of the same caliber.\n\nConclusion: Overall, this is a very nice GPU with subtle, yet pretty RGB and had great temps and performance all the way round. While it is one of the more larger GPU heatsinks I've seen, both in width and length, as I've said, its able to manage the RTX 2070 quietly and effectively. As a first time PC builder, this was incredibly easy to install and setup, and would recommend for someone who wants RTX power, but at a reasonable price to performance ratio."}, {"title": "Quality Gaming GPU - Smooth Performance", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2019", "text": "This was my first \u201cGaming\u201d PC build (it\u2019s for my teenage son) and the GPU was the last component we needed to complete the build. After a great deal of research and consideration, we ended up choosing the MSI RTX 2070 Gaming Z. Our motherboard is a MSI MPG Z390 Gaming Pro Carbon AC, so we decided to maintain consistency and stick with one of MSI\u2019s offerings. The MSI RTX 2070 Gaming Z is a mid to upper level GPU, both in performance and price. The Ray Tracing capability (RTX) is not widely supported at this time by game creators, however it should be more widely utilized in the next year or two. Nvidia recently released the GTX 1660 and GTX 1660 Ti, which seems to be their attempt at providing a more affordable alternative however it does not support Ray Tracing, it has less CUDA cores, and it also has less memory. We opted for the RTX 2070 Gaming Z because it should be a little more \u201cfuture-proof\u201d and provide good, steady, and stable performance without the need to upgrade as soon. So far, the GPU is performing flawlessly! Super easy installation and setup. The RGB LEDs look cool and it is amazingly quiet during operation. The MSI RTX 2070 Gaming Z is factory overclocked so I would recommend downloading and using MSI\u2019s Afterburner software (free from MSI website) to monitor and adjust the GPU performance.

My teen did some quick online research, and it was a simple fix (that didn\u2019t require any physical alteration) where I recall he just had to initialize the HDD. There haven\u2019t been any other issues. He has no lagging and gets really fast boot times due to the SSD and lack of bloatware. His favorite game is CS:GO, and that\u2019s what he plays the most. CS:GO runs great and is always smooth regardless of the map, and he\u2019s always sitting at 300 FPS (he caps it there for less strain and fluctuation).

I used HWMonitor to check temps and voltages and then ran Heaven Benchmark. The card got through the Basic test okay but temps were high. Running the Extreme test caused the program to crash and the card to hit north of 70\u00b0 C each of three separate times.\n\nI tried playing some less graphically intense games such as Stellaris and Subnautica but was still having performance problems. I decided I didn\u2019t want to play around with the card any longer and returned it for replacement.

I searched for software to control these but couldn't find anything on either the ASUS or Nvidia websites. I ended up removing the cooler, pulling the LED power cable from the connector, and reassembling. That at least turned off these LEDs.\n\nThe second problem I had was when I tried to install a Corsair XG7 RGB GPU waterblock. It physically fit on, but the card would not work, no output to the monitor, not even during boot. I don't know for sure, but I think the card checks to see if the fan is working and shuts down if one is not plugged in. Which was a bummer.

When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash.

Auf Youtube gibt es anschauliche Vergleichsvideos, in welchem man bspw 1050ti gegen GTX680 usw selber ansehen kann.\n\nDie Karte treibt hier 2 Displays, eines davon UDH 3840*2160, und \u00e4ltere bzw. weniger anspruchsvolle Titel wie WoW/WoT usw laufen mit angepassten&reduzierten Einstellungen auch auf 3840*2160 problemlos mit 60fps, bei um die 60-70% Auslastung der Karte.\n\nThema 4K - die Karte bietet HDCP 2.2, und mit den derzeitigen Betatreibern stellt Netflix auch schon 4K dar - inklusive hardwarebeschleunigtem H265. wenn man also einen lautlosen MediaPC mit 4K plant - ein wichtiger Vorteil, da Nvidias \u00e4ltere Karten (9er, 8er, 7er Serie) kein 4K bei Netflix unterst\u00fctzen.\n\nDie Karte bietet 3 gleichzeitig nutzbare Anschl\u00fcsse, 1* Display Port, 1* DL-DVI, 1* HDMI, inklusive digitalem Surround-Ton auf HDMI&DP.\n\nDie Abmessungen von 182*142mm L\u00e4nge*H\u00f6he bei eingehaltener Breite von 2 Slots sind in Mini-Geh\u00e4usen wie dem Fractal Design Core 500 problemlos, allerdings sollte man bei ULTRAULTRAkompakten mini-ITX Geh\u00e4usen vorher pr\u00fcfen, ob die 142mm H\u00f6he passen.\n\nDie passive K\u00fchlung l\u00e4uft gut und reicht aus - bei Film & Video, Desktop & Browsen im Bereich 40 Grad. Auch bei typischer mittlerer 3D-Spiele Last wie WoW bleibt alles im gr\u00fcnen Bereich, da ist die Karte nach einer Stunde 4K mit 60 fps im 60 Grad-Bereich, alles komplett L\u00fcfter&lautlos. Das ganze im f\u00fcr passiv gek\u00fchlte Systeme mit etwas mehr Anspruch sehr gut geeignetem Fractal Design Core 500 Geh\u00e4use, in welchem die Karte senkrecht steht und alleine schon durch ihre Eigenkonvenktion einen guten Luftfluss erzeugt - und von unten, Seiten und nach oben gut Luft bekommt bzw abgeben kann. In einem *geschlossenem* oder *sehr engem* Mini-Geh\u00e4use allerdings k\u00f6nnte das problematischer werden.\n\nUnter konstanter & totaler Volllast, getestet mit synthetischer Folter-Last mittels \"Furmark\", ohne jeglichen L\u00fcfter irgendwo im Geh\u00e4use, kann man sie ins thermische Limit kriegen, das bei etwa 83 Grad erreicht wird. Die Karte st\u00fcrzt dann nicht ab oder \u00fcberhitzt gnadenlos, sie stellt dann \"nur\" noch den normalen 1290Mhz Takt zur Verf\u00fcgung, den beschleunigte 1392Mhz Boosttakt nicht mehr und geht ggf. sogar nach l\u00e4ngerer Zeit auf um die 1.1Ghz runter um nicht zu \u00fcberhitzen. Anders als die GPU und die Spannungswandler sind die RAM-Speicherchips (Hersteller: Micron) geizigerweise nicht am K\u00fchlk\u00f6rper angekoppelt, und werden bedenklich heiss. Stabil und absturzfrei bleibt aber alles, allerdings dann eben nicht mehr auf maximalen / turbo-Tempo. Sobald auch nur ein superlangsam rotierender, unh\u00f6rbar leiser (Netzteil)L\u00fcfter mit 300 Umdrehungen im Geh\u00e4use Luft zirkuliert, ist selbst unter solcher Horror-Last wie Furmark die Karte non-stop auf Vollgas und bleibt k\u00fchl genug.\n\nDie Leistungsaufnahme, auch unter Volllast, bleibt bequem innerhalb der PCIe-Spezifikationen, sprich, man braucht keine zus\u00e4tzlichen Stromversorgungskabel. Allerdings haben schw\u00e4chere passiv gek\u00fchlte Karten wie die GTX750 oder AMD460 noch weniger Leistungsaufnahme unter Vollast, die Mehrleistung der GTX1050ti schlug beim Messen mit pi mal Daumen 10 Watt mehr zu Buche. Unter normaler Last, wie Desktop, Video, nicht max\u00edmal anspruchsvollen 3D Spielen hingegen ist die Leistungsaufnahme \u00e4hnlich bis gleich, bei 3D Spielen sogar teilweise etwas geringer, da dann die Nvidia750 oder AMD460 auf Volllast laufen und die 1050ti oft nur zu 60%-70% Last hast.\n\nDer Lieferumfang ist knapp. Keine Kabel, keine Spiele oder Playersoftware, aber immerhin ein Softwaretool mit dem man Taktraten usw einstellen kann.\n\nFazit\nprima:\n++ v\u00f6llig lautlos, auch keine elektronische St\u00f6rger\u00e4usche wie fiepende Spulen\n++ voller 4K Support, inkl HDCP 2.2 mit 4K/UHD Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr Netflix & co\n++ f\u00fcr passive K\u00fchlung h\u00f6chste 3D&2D-Performance im Markt (Stand Mai 2017), in etwa wie eine Geforce GTX680.\n++ 3 Monitore/Fernseher/Projektoren ansteuerbar\n++ HDMI, DP, DL-DVI\n++ passiver Betrieb bei normaler Last ohne jeglichen L\u00fcfter v\u00f6llig problemlos, 40 Grad desktop, 60-70 Grad 3D/Spiele.\n++ volle H265 Unterst\u00fctzung in Hardware\n++ 4GB Speicher\n\ngut\n+ saubere Surround-Sound Implementation auf HDMI/DP, allerdings keinerlei weitere Einstellm\u00f6glichkeiten ausser Windows.\n+ keine weitere Stromversorgung n\u00f6tig, PCIE reicht. Leistungsaufnahme unter Vollast allerdings eine Spur h\u00f6her als AMD460 und GTX750\n+ immerhin nicht nur 2 Jahre Gew\u00e4hrleistung, sondern volle Garantie, aber andere Hersteller bieten auch 3 oder 5 Jahre.\n+ Karte st\u00fcrzt auch unter synthetischer Horror-Vollast wie Furmark ohne jegliche K\u00fchlung nicht ab, sondern h\u00e4lt sich selber im thermischen Limit, indem sie auf Basistakt bzw 1.1 Ghz geht.\n\nsolala\n-+ Lieferumfang bietet zwar ein Tool zum Einstellen von Taktraten usw, aber sonst eben auch nicht mehr.\n\nschlecht\n- RAM Speicherchips sind nicht mit dem K\u00fchlk\u00f6rper verbunden und werden unter konstanter absoluter maximallast (wie furmark) ohne jegliche L\u00fcftung dadurch knapp \u00fcberhalb ihrer Herstellervorgaben erhitzt. Die 20-50 cent Einsparung bei der Herstellung f\u00fcr ein paar W\u00e4rmeleitpads&Baseplate sind geizig.\n\nEinfach gesagt: F\u00fcr lautlos/l\u00fcfterlos passiv gek\u00fchlte Systeme ist die Palit 1050ti Kalm Stand Mai 2017 - und auch auf absehbare Zeit - die st\u00e4rkste Grafikkarte im Markt. Die 3D Leistung ist dabei bequem auf dem Level von nicht all zu alten einstigen Flagschiffen wie der Nvidia GTX680. Weiterhin erm\u00f6glicht sie 4K Netflix und co (derzeit allerdings noch mit Betatreibern, die aber stabil liefen), was sonst kaum Grafikkarten erlauben, und auch weniger leistungshungrige Spiele (wie WoW) laufen mit etwas runtergedrehter G\u00fcte selbst bei nur 60-70% Grafikkartenlast auf 4K mit 60fps.\n\nWenn noch mehr, nonstop, 100% maximale 3D Last, 24 Stunden 7 Tage die Woche geplant ist, bspw. als lautloser Numbercruncher, non-stop-video-encoder oder Renderknecht - w\u00fcrde ich pers\u00f6nlich allerdings irgendwo im Geh\u00e4use (und sei es Netzteil) einen ultralangsam rotierenden, und unh\u00f6rbaren grossen L\u00fcfter montieren - da Palit die RAM-Chips nicht mit dem K\u00fchlk\u00f6rper verbunden hat und die wenn auch stabil, doch sehr heiss sind und zudem die Karte ohne jeglichen Luftstrom unter Horrorlast den Turbotakt nicht einsetzt um nicht zu \u00fcberhitzen. Ich habe das (im f\u00fcr passive Systeme sehr zu empfehlenden Fractal Design Core 500) ganz einfach gel\u00f6st: Das hat einen gro\u00dfen und bei langsamer Drehung unh\u00f6rbar leisen L\u00fcfter, der aus ist. Ich habe den auf dem Mainboard (Asus) so eingestellt, dass dieser bei 75 Grad anl\u00e4uft. Nach einer Woche Betrieb, darunter auch n\u00e4chtelang Dauerlast als Videoencoder ist das nicht einmal passiert. Wenn ich allerdings Horrortests a la Furmark anwerfe, setzt er sich nach einiger Zeit in Bewegung, aus 1 Meter Abstand unh\u00f6rbar, und die Karte bleibt auf Vollgas & k\u00fchl. Somit ist die Sicherheit gegeben, dass auch im Hochsommer nichts \u00fcberhitzt, und ansonsten 100% l\u00fcfter&lautlos.\n\nWegen den eingesparten W\u00e4rmepads am RAM-Speicher w\u00fcrde ich eigentlich nur 4 Sterne geben, aber: Das ist schon sehr theoretische Kritik, und man kriegt im Alltag die st\u00e4rkste lautlose Video & 3D Karte, in allen normalen Szenarien inkl. nicht maximal leistungshungriger Spiele problemlos zu k\u00fchlen, mit vergleichweise sparsamer Leistungsaufnahme - ideal f\u00fcr Home-entertainment PCs, auch mit Netflix 4K, genug 3D Power auch f\u00fcr viele Spiele (in FHD sowieso), H265 in Hardware, selbst 3D-Anwendungen kann man gut nutzen, 4GB RAM und sobald auch nur ein schwacher Luftzug (Netzteill\u00fcfter?) herrscht ist alles im tiefgr\u00fcnen Bereich?

I'm liking the AMD software now. They've made improvements since my last AMD card (which was back in the early 2000s).\n\nSo... the card: It's quite nice. I like the little bit of LED color on it. The card's on the big side, barely making it into my ATX case, and it definitely butts up against the neighboring slot making it useless, but that's fine. I guess I didn't need to add USB C to my motherboard after all.\n\nThe card runs cool, even when I'm pushing it. I don't overclock (I'm not an FPS-obsessed twitch gamer) and I'm quite pleased with the quality of graphics and frames I'm getting on games like The Witcher III and GTA V. Older games run great. Skyrim, Fallout 4, all the Batman games-- All deliver well over 60fps on Ultra as long as I turn VSync off (which is fine since AMD has their own version).\n\nThis is also a really quiet card. It never gets much louder than my case fans. I can't hear it over the sound of my refrigerator running in the next room (OK, yeah, my fridge is old but it's not THAT loud).\n\nAll in all, this was a worthwhile jump up.

On Linux, it is comparable to an RX 580 but that should change once drivers improve. Search for benchmarks online (e.g., Phoronix and FurMark).\n\nWhere it really shines through is the power efficiency of the card thanks to the new architecture. This means a cooler and quieter system that won't hit your utility bill as hard.\n\nIt's true that this card is limited to 8x PCIe 4.0, but if you have a compatible motherboard then the bandwidth will be the same as a 16x PCIe 3.0 slot. It should also be noted that this card is meant for 1080p gaming so you should not expect to use up all your VRAM like you would at higher resolutions, thus, there should not be much demand placed on the PCIe bus to cause a bottleneck.\n\nI was initially concerned about the aforementioned issue and looked at the RX 580, but after a bit of research and considering that the RX 580 was still much more expensive than the newer gen card, I took a chance with the RX 5500 XT and have been very pleased ever since.\n\nWhat I did not like was that this card was not shipped in its original box but in thin bubble wrap and placed inside a large Amazon box, allowing it to shift around easily during transit with the potential of damaging its fragile connector.

This is a huge pet peeve of mine and it falsely lowers the overall ratings which forces everyone to read between the lines when reading amazon reviews! Reviewers you need a working card to do a proper review and although D.O.A. cards still occur it's part of technology so just accept it and send it back for a new card under the 3 year Asus warranty or Amazons 30 day return/replace policy.\nI only buy AMD Radeon video cards because Nvidia really over prices their GPU's, chipsets, and power supplies by at least 30 % and I'm not over paying for video cards no matter who produces them.\nI wanted to get a good card that plays well at 1920x1080p and will still play my Military Flight Simulators and F.P.S. games without any issues. The Asus RX 570 was plenty fast enough for gaming and even scored a 71% in 3DMark which is great for a 7 year old system still running a i5 2500k CPU.\n\nI do not over- clock my CPU (But it will run at almost 5 GHZ if I chose to do so since I have a nice closed loop water cooler) I also will never over-clock my GPU because I want stability over speed. Over-clocking really helped out back in the past with the 66 MHZ bus on the intel PII's that ran at 333 MHZ. These hit perfectly on a 100 MHZ bus giving me a rock stable CPU running at 500 MHZ back when intel didn't even have a 400 MHZ CPU on the market!\nBut that was then and now a days the intel CPU's are being milked for all intel can get while they change their socket sizes so your forced to buy a new board as well.\nThis Asus RX-570 is well built even though it's fan cover is plastic it's rather light which eliminates sag issues so it's a plus not a negative. I bought it for the double ball bearing fans and 8 gig of DDR5! I waited a year for the prices to get back to normal from all the bitcoin miners and this card is well worth the money and then some. For only $162 this 570 with 8 gig of onboard ram is great value!\nI don't recommend using the Asus software that comes with the card since it's very buggy and the Radeon settings can be set just fine without any additional software.\n\nAsus Expedition RX-570_8 GIG video card Update:\nI have been using the new card for almost 4 months and it runs great with both Windows 7 Pro and Windows 10 Pro 64 bit O/S's\nI recently went back to Win 7 Pro over Win 10 Pro because Win 10 Pro would not run 2 of my favorite Military Sims. Well they would load and I could finish a mission but then the game would crash my system and force me to lose any pilot stats, which ruins the fun of playing realistic flight sims and could have led to some hard restarts that can damage the O/S. I know from personal use that Win 7 Pro 64 bit just runs games better than Windows 10, when it comes to compatibility, and is still a solid Operating System that most gamers still use.\nWindows 10 Pro gets bad reviews across the board but I found it to be an excellent O/S with only Linux's latest being more stable and of course free.\nO.K. back to the new video card. I can't find any flaws with this card at all. It lacks a black-plate but is really light weight and has a great closed loop heat pipe system, along with the great, real, ball bearing fans, that are so quiet I can't even hear them while I'm gaming. There is zero whine that other cards produce under load and I love that feature.\nI only needed a good video card with 4 gig of ram and was looking at a RX-560, but this Asus card and it's 8 gig of DDR5 gave my system and game performance a great boost and was well worth the year long wait not to over pay.\n\nIf you need a solid card with quiet fans and like the idea of 8 gig of DDR 5 ram look no further! I have seen a couple of Sapphire cards inthe RX-580 series in July of 2019 priced at only $180 which would have been my first choice if I was buying today. But you can drive yourself crazy if you keep looking at current GPU's prices since the new Radeons are out and getting cheaper all the time. So I always get the best single card for the money and can always buy a second if I upgrade my CPU to a AMD Ryson 1600, my motherboard with a AM4 socket and 16 gig of DDR4 memory.\nI priced out this upgrade path and for $450 I can basically get a brand new computer(self built) and add a second Asus RX-570 for Cross-Fire use.\nI have bought Sapphire cards in the past and have had good luck with them however, they only have a 2 year warr. and that extra year that Asus offers can be important. I did have a Asus HD 6950 years ago that failed after 2 1/2 years and would have been a paperweight if I didn't have that extra year of warranty as Asus replaced it with no questions asked.

Most cards that have an output layout like this are fake and, seeing reviews from people saying it won't run DX11, I'm inclined to believe this isn't even a 6770 as those did run DX11. The listed clock speed is about 200mhz lower than the original cards which, at best, points to these being faulty cards flashed with a different BIOS to operate at a lower clock speed. HD 5770s and 6770s (same card with 2 names) also NEVER came with 4GB of VRAM.\n\nAgain, this points to this being a card with a fake BIOS. I've tested another faked GPU claiming to be a GTX 960 4GB and the card even reported itself as such to the computer. In actuality it was a GT640 with 1GB of VRAM. When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash.

showed up once and i missed it, but claimed they did twice (even amazon.com assured me that their record only showed one pickup) .it's a lie, because since missed the pickup, i've become a house-arrested guy awaiting UPS to show up again, they never did. i called their 800 number so many times, repeat my request again and again, talked to so many so-called customer service people, male and female, asked me to hold, forced me to listen to their elevator music so many times and so long, then there would become another person asking me to repeat the tracking number, and again gave me a pick time. one of their people even called me back to confirm that they would pick up the next day. but it never carried out.\n\nthis is the worst and the most lousy mail service in the world operated

as screensaver.\nother than that, couldn't play anything normally, got white screens, frozen player screen. anything video just showed section by section images, if the movie images moved fast horizontally, flashing appeared. most weird was that audio sound was faster than the video. sometimes with frozen image on screen but the audio proceeded without delays.\nalthough this turned out to be a very funny card, seemed to be not compatible with the old hp pavilion a1240n media center pc, but i would still blame the pc itself instead of this card. this hp pavilion is not good, the on board video display adapter turned all the icons on the monitor screen flat horizontally, there are doodlu-doodlu grumbling noises constantly coming out when processing, any new instruction by the mouse pointer would cause the noises gone crazy during processing.\n\n2 gb memory upgrade seems to be useless at all, upgraded to wins 7 seems making everything worse than when the os was windows xp

Who would have thought slots would have changed so much in only 4 years?\n\nIt took about 5 minutes to configure the bios to use the nVidia PCI graphics card instead of the on-board Intel one. You'd have to do the same thing under Windows. Once I did that, Ubuntu booted up in 1920x1080 automatically with the open-source driver.

It's definitely crisper using my LCD monitor at full resolution.\n\nAfter seeing how easy this was and how nicely it works with Linux, I plan to make this system an entertainment center and upgrade my desktop to a 64-bit system with a newer nVidia card. Previously I'd been afraid that only Intel cards would play nicely with Linux, but using this card with Linux couldn't have been any easier.

The consensus is that the 512's are a waste of money. Someone stated in another review that you have to disable the old card first. You do it as follows: Start, Control Panel, System, Hardware, Device Manager, left click on the \"cross\" to the right of Display Adapters, right click on Graphics Controller (or it will be the only one listed), left click \"disable,\" turn off PC, install new card, start PC, PC should recognize new hardware, download new software, update new software (there's new drivers since the 5/08 ones on the disc), go back to device manager and uninstall the old card if you want.\nBefore I did this the new card would not take, and all I got was a black screen upon rebooting the PC. I had to reinstall the old card and do the above procedure before I could install the new one and get it to work. Anyway the card works great, vivid colors, ok 3D graphics, more detail as advertised, and I can play all the non high end games I want. No more jerking performance, freezing up and crashing of games.

At first, it disliked my wifi card, but after swapping slots, it worked fine. (It's in the slot farthest from the CPU.) The only downside is that, after installing the included driver, the on-board video was disabled and I had to use the second port (DVI-A, but I used the included adapter to connect my VGA monitor) instead.

The Noctura heatsink dwarfs it! Looked for this form factor for future build even though it is in a Riotoro CR1080 case on a full ATX board. This will eventually go and downsize to mini-itx.

I wanted to add a 3rd monitor so I purchased this graphics card to add to my existing configuration.\n\nAfter all the setup problems the graphics card is driving the 3rd monitor just fine and everything is good but be aware of various problems I encountered getting to this point.\n\nAfter installing the card and powering up the system windows recognized the new card. While it was attempting to install the drivers the 2 existing monitors went black (and the new monitor was not functioning yet - no drivers installed at this point). After about 3 minutes the my 2 original monitors came back. I should have stopped there.\n\nSince I generally don't fully trust windows, before I enabled the 3rd monitor I used the included CD to install the ATI/AMD specific software and drivers. After about 5 minutes of installation the monitors went black again. This time they all were still black about 45 minutes later. So I pulled the plug on the PC and restarted.\n\nOnce restarting the system it recognized 1 monitor as a generic adapter/monitor (i.e. resolution all messed up). After going into Device Manager I noted the yellow warning triangle on the graphics cards. I had windows update the driver for my original 4650 and that brought back both of my original monitors (although I had to reboot). Then I went back to Device Manager and had Windows update the driver for this card (5450). After a reboot I was able to go into Control Panel > Screen Resolution and Detect the 3rd monitor.\n\nSo now I have 3 monitors up and working but no sound. When I hover over the speaker icon it says \"No speakers or headphones are plugged in\" which i new wasn't correct but since I had to pull the case off I double checked all connections and scratched my head. A google search turned up the following link [...]. Apparently its fairly common for graphics card to assume you don't want to use the on board audio and your speakers but instead want to use their audio piped to the monitor through the HDMI connection. After following the directions in the article (and another reboot) I was able to get the sound back.\n\nDon't know why this had to be so difficult but be warned."}, {"title": "It gave me more than what I expected, at a very reasonable price.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2013", "text": "In my particular case, I was beefing up a computer--a Dell Optiplex small form factor 'hotbox' for my brother.

My criteria for purchase was: \"Had to be low profile, had to be cool. Had to use very little power. Oh, and dimensions.\"\n\nMan, was I stunned...! It can play Left 4 Dead and Team Fortress 2 at max settings (1280X1024 though) with no hiccups, and some programs that didn't recognize the integrated graphics before, suddenly worked...! Even a beefy demo like Sonic Generations actually ran about 20 fps on the card, which is at least playable, and he's played through all of Mirror's Edge (Medium, I think?), all of which were essentially unplayable on the integrated chipset.\n\nIt's been in use fairly frequently for about 2 months now, and it doesn't show signs of suddenly collapsing or anything, (I was being way too careful benchmarking/testing the thing,) and even immediately after a heavy hour-long session of intense display and then powering of the machine, the heatsink itself was certainly hot to the touch, but I could still lay my hand upon it comfortably (about a 20 second delay from when I unplugged the computer) and the Catalyst software monitors never go significantly above 60 degrees C. More impressively, I read that this thing pulls 20W of power under its heaviest load, which is baffling how it manages to do what it does anyway with so little!\n\nI'll echo what's been said before--you're better off to save up if you want a gaming card, but if it's just video editing/processing, and games typically older than, say, 2009 or so (not caring for max settings, just nice ones), you probably can't beat this price... If somebody's in a bizarre situation like mine, then let me assure him/her: people aren't kidding when they say that 'anything' discrete is better than integrated graphics. I just honestly didn't expect the wonderfully enormous difference...!\n\nI guess my negatives would be the box art looks really goofy, (=D) and I have my suspicions the Catalyst software (newest version from the site, yes) is a little... stupid...? (I once somehow had two instances, at the same time... it was odd.) Also, setting up the low profile bracket, I had just BARELY enough tape to make the VGA port reach to the new bracket--which was on the card's underside in the incredibly stupid layout of this incredibly stupid case.

I decided to re-purpose it as an low budget HTPC (for now) as I'm paying $300 a year to the cable company to rent a cable box and DVR. With this rig and Windows Media Center I have a much better user interface as well as a central hub for all my media needs. One of the things the GX620 is notorious for is the design flaw in the small form chassis that causes it to overheat easily. This usually causes the CPU fan to sound like a vacuum cleaner. So I upgraded to a core duo processor, added some RAM, and (after days of research) decided to get this video card. I basically only wanted to invest the absolute minimum to ensure the system runs safely and relatively smoothly. There were basically 3 criteria. 1)It had to be low power usage since the GX620 only has 275W available on its stock PSU. 2)It had to be a low-profile pci card because the chassis. 3)Again, because of the stock PSU not having any spare connectors this card couldn't have any fan. It had to have a passive cooling system which this one does with an attached heatsink. Plus it didn't hurt there was a $15 rebate on this card bringing my overall budget down.\n\nAt first I was concerned about it fitting. The card comes with different kinds of brackets depending on what kind of chassis you have. I installed the low-profile one and it snapped in without a problem. The HDMI has a clear, unobstructed path to connect. I plugged it into to my Olevia TV (LT32HV)in my bedroom where I've been testing WMC before setting it up in the living room. The first time everything loaded fine. Windows 7 recognized the card and automatically installed the drivers.When the system rebooted the BIOS screen showed up fine but when it was loading windows the image went black and my TV had an \"invalid format\" message. I rebooted several times and nothing.When I rebooted in safe mode the image showed but no matter what changes I made to the resolution I had the same issue when rebooting to regular Windows. I tried researching online and the consensus I got was that the TV's firmware needed updating since it was an older HDTV. This was disappointing especially since I cannot find that darn firmware anywhere.I honestly thought something was wrong with the card. So I decided to connect my HTPC to my livingroom Samsung 52\" tv (where it's supposed to end up anyway) and everything worked flawlessly. The sound and video all came through the HDMI without making any changes or tinkering with settings. It looks marvelous. The card does get hot but that's what the heatsink is for.\n\nGreat value!

I have never done that before but it was pretty easy after a brief inspection.\n\nOnce I installed the Radeon HD5450, I placed the case cover back on but it wouldn't sit flush. Turns out that the 5450 is a bit wider than my original card by about 5 mm. The issue is that the cooling fins wrap around the top edge of the card; you can see it in the picture.\n\nThis isn't a deal breaker. I just left the case cover off and since it sits on my desk facing the wall, it's not visible.\n\nThis card should be able to play most games but don't expect too much.

MOH ran acceptably on the Optiplex but there was the occassional lag and screen tearing. My guess is that it is the Pentium 4 processor that is holding back this game and not the graphics card.

No power cable needed, so it was easy to install (barring the insane design of the rear panel slot covers on this PC). It works fine with the 300W power supply, even with a second hard drive installed in the tower used for recording - the highest-resource activity on the system, and it gets the onboard CPU fan going hard too. The card fits very nicely into the space of a single PCI slot, which was absolutely vital since the TV tuner is adjacent to it. Someone else pointed out that the low-profile heat sink wraps around the edge of the card, which is true, but since the PCIe 16x slot is at the top in our system, there's nothing at that height on that side of it so it isn't a problem.

Not only is my framerate very high (above 80 for most games on ultra settings,1080p) but the card runs quiet and cool. Games like PUBG, Elder Scrolls, CSGO and Crysis all run like a dream. Not much difference between this Gigabyte 170 card and the MSi card, the msi card just card looks prettier and has a backplate. No difference in performance. If you want a better looking card, go with the msi 1070, but if you're like me and don't care about looks too much, the gigabyte card is the right choice since you'll save some cash.\n\nI will write another review once i try out my system on a 1440p, 144hz monitor since this card can run that resolution very well also. This card is a little bit overkill for the 1080p, but since i plan on upgrading to running 1440p in the near future, that's why I paid more for this card instead of a 1060. As far as 4k, this card can handle it, it's just that you'll sacrifice your framerate and get more like 26-30fps. For 4k, definitely get a 1080 and some solid cooling.\n\nOverall this card crushes any game I throw at it. Only cons would be that it doesn't look as pretty as the other 1070's.\n\nUpdate: 5/5/2018. It\u2019s been almost a year with this card and I must say I\u2019m impressed. No issues whatsoever yet. I also upgraded to a 1440p 144hz monitor and I can still run any modern game with 80+ fps easily.

Here is some basic information: Upgraded from a \"Zotac GTZ 970 AMP! Omega\". My overall system specs (as relevent to the GPU) are as follows: Windows 10, with a Intel I7-4790K. I play exclusively on a 1080p, 60hz monitor with a projector hooked up occasionally as a second screen. Mostly play a heavily modded Skyrim, FO4, the Total War series, and things of that nature.\n\nPros:\n\n- Easily averaging about 15-20fps more than my old 970 across the board. This means a relatively stable 60fps with v-sync in most titles. Only exception being ARMA 3 where I have yet to meet a system that can average 60fps (this comes close at a usual 45-50fps).\n\n- Very quiet, some \"coil whine\" but its almost negligible.\n\n- Compared to my old 970 it is tiny. Its a little longer, but is much less thick. I do not have a motherboard that supports SLI (only Crossfire - the AMD equivalent), but if I did this card would be ideal for it due to its small size.\n\nCons\n\n- Runs hot, very hot. I can feel the case getting hot when I play pretty much anything for more than a half hour. If you look into it the 1070s seem to be designed to run hot so in fairness it probably isn't an issue with the cards if they are made to handle it, but it is a little alarming. It has yet to max out the fan usage on it's own, I've had to go and manually adjust the fan speed to see if that helps. On it's own I've never seen it go past 88% fan speed.\n\nOverall I'm giving it a 4, but I have to admit its a solid improvement and I don't regret buying it."}, {"title": "No issues, very clean", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2022", "text": "All of the cards were very well packaged (not original packing, but thats not expected as these are used cards).

Smooth as butter for all but super competitive FPS competition - no real need for 1080 unless pushing 3 monitors and want ultra settings on your games\n4) If all you want is 1440p, single or dual monitor and are good with 100 frames or less on ultra settings, this is fine (which will likely be everyone but the hardest core gamers)\n5) For anything 1080p, and I mean pretty much anything, this card is enough - maybe overkill"}, {"title": "As expected: perfectly adequate", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2017", "text": "This is one of the cheaper GTX 1070 models available.

The card was very easy to install, it is basically plug and play. It came from the factory with a small overclock. Zotac's software, Firestorm, is easy to use and helps to monitor the card during gameplay. I never ran into any power issues, but I never tried to overclock because my PSU is just over the required minimum to run the card.\nGames that run respectably on high settings 1080p include: Deceit, CSGO, Overwatch, Forza Motorsport 7, Gmod, Rocket League, and Fortnite\nGames that run respectably on medium settings 1080p include: Hunt: Showdown (usually mid 40s-low 50s), COD Black Ops 4, The Hunter Call of the Wild (w/ some settings on high)\nBasically if it's a AAA title than it will run on medium with some high settings.

I've tested another faked GPU claiming to be a GTX 960 4GB and the card even reported itself as such to the computer. In actuality it was a GT640 with 1GB of VRAM. When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash.

For me, DX12 performance is the MOST important area of focus, especially for Nvidia since AMD has and continues to dominate its Nvidia counterparts at every price tier in DX12...in fact, Nvidia cards have actually displayed performance loss in switching from DX11 to DX12, and with the controversy surrounding Nvidia's Maxwell architecture (900 Series cards) and their complete inability to perform asyncronous switching at the hardware level, DX12, in my opinion, is where the GTX 1080 had to prove itself. The majority of new AAA PC game releases will quickly become DX12, especially since Xbox One has already fully implemented it, and because DX12 is such a superior API and places in the hands of the game developers the responsibility of ensuring games perform up to par on a piece of hardware, the performance of a given game on a given GPU isn't dependent on the GPU manufacture's ability to create perfect drivers anymore. What this means is that Nvidia's advantage in DX11 performance, largely because of their ability and budget for creating drivers, is no more, and AMD's former disadvantage will disappear as well. Now, the onus is on the GPU hardware to perform and not the programming. DX12 performance becomes even more important when you consider the rather expensive price on this card and that it factors into the desire to get as much use out of it as one can for as long as one can, preferably at least two years, so while DX12 might not be the sole API currently, sooner than later it will, and the GTX 1080's performance in DX12 will determine its life expectancy.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to report that the GTX 1080's performance in DX12 is, for lack of a better word, embarrassing, especially at 4K where one would expect this card to be able to perform and maintain at the least 60fps @ 3840x2160 resolution. Not only does it not achieve the necesssary 60fps, but the performance gains that the GTX 1080 obtains in the switch from DX11 to DX12 hovers around an average of a few percentage points, literally (the biggest improvement being about 3% now that I recall). What's even more disappointing is that the GTX 1080 only manages a few FPS more than the AMD Fury X in DX12 @ 4K. In fact, in Ashes of the Singularity, the GTX 1080 only manages 53.3FPS while the Fury X achieves an extremely close 49.0FPS. Again, in Hitman, the GTX 1080 achieves 47.0FPS and the Fury X 44.2FPS! To me at least, this is unacceptable on nvidia's part, especially considering that the GTX has an inherent advantage over the Fury X in that the former is produced on the 16nm node, while the latter is on the now relatively old 28nm process. Additionally, Nvidia had plenty of forwarning about DX12 and AMD's considerable advantage as a result of the hardware's ability to do asynchronous compute, so it's not as if Nvidia was caught off guard or blindsided; they've known for plenty of time that it is a big deal. I've attached a chart with a few examples of the GTX 1080's DX12 performance, and while some of you may look at the results from Rise of the Tomb Raider and say, \"Hey, the GTX 1080 did a lot better than the Fury X in that game\"...well, while it may be true on the surface that the GTX 1080 did considerably better in RotTR, an important consideration has to be pointed out in that at the last minute, prior to that game's release, Nvidia had the developers remove the use of Asynchronous compute, which while making the GTX 1080 appear better, is a serious disservice to the players of the game who happen to own hardware capable of producing major performance boosts from Async compute. In order to not appeaer like such a failure in DX12, Nvidia was willing to ruin the experiences of a large swath of players to achieve such misleading results. So even though it may appear like a redeeming result for nvida, in reality the RotTR numbers only further highlight Pascal's lack of async compute, for if the geme developers left the feature in like the originally intended, the GTX 1080's results would be much in the vein of the other DX12 games.\n\nTo conclude, I do not see the GTX 1080 to be the \"savior from heaven\" that so many reviewers and fanboys hyped it up to be. Sure, the DX11 performance can result in advantages of up to 20FPS fpr the GTX 1080 over the Titan X, but considering DX11 is on it's way out and more and more titles in the past few months as well as in the months to come will be DX12, I feel as though the DX11 performance is not enough on it's own to warrant upgrading for current owners of a Maxwell/900 series GPU and especially owners of a 980Ti or Titan X. I think I can speak for many of us when I say that the community expected this card, especially considering the node shrink and new architecture, should be capable of a minimum of 60fps @ 4K and especially in DX12, but it just doesn't deliver. The problem is only excacerbated by the fact that since DX12 is \"closer to the metal\" than previous APIs and doesnt depend on driver support nearly as much, if the GTX 1080 isn't performing in DX12 now, it's not going to magically achieve a market leap in performance later though software wizardry as was capable with DX11. My advice is to avoid upgrading right now, unless youre coming from the 700 series or less, as the GTX 1080 just does not deliver what its price and technology would suggest. Personally, I'm waiting for AMD's Vega Architecture (the successor to Fiji/Fury X) as it will have HBM2 and will most certainly impress with its DX12 performance as all AMD cards have done so far.\n\n**I'd just like to iterate the fact that I am NOT an AMD fanboy, I have no alliegence to any brand, and only judge a given product on it's own merits, aka its price:performance ratio. My critical review of the GTX 1080 is solely motivated by my belief in the fact that DX12 performance is a factor of tantamount importance to any other, and the GTX 1080 just does not deliver in this respect."}, {"title": "From a 745 to a 1080 its an amazing GPU. 5 stars!", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2016", "text": "From a 745 to a 1080 its amazing GPU. 5 stars!\n\nI have the HP ENVY Phoenix 810-430qe with 32 GB ram and a i7-4790 Intel core processor.

Long story short it came factory installed with a Nividia Geforce GTX 745.\n\nI'm a hardcore gamer, do video editing and render a lot of images and with a GTX 745 it just was not durable anymore so I decided to\ndo a major upgrade. Now let me say for those who do not have a custom rig it is very possible to install\nan EVGA Geforce GTX 1080 into an HP ENVY Desktop if your tower has the right measurements. The GTX 1080 is about 10.5 inches in\nlength and fit perfectly with room to spare.\n\nThe reason I chose to get the Founders Edition instead of the\ncustom GTX 1080s coming out is because of the cooler design for airflow. The GTX 1080 Founders Edition ejects heat from the rear\nof the tower instead of storing it within the tower which is a very big deal especially if you have a smaller tower like I do.\n\nIf you can afford the extra $100 bucks do not hesitate. Its very fast as in it renders images and plays any game easily without any struggle\ndepending on your game settings.\n\nI've tested some benchmarks myself with everything turned up on ultra settings and it handles 4K very well with overclocking of course.\nOnly games tested so far is Doom( 55 fps), Grand Theft Auto V( 59 fps), and The Witcher 3 (44 fps) very impressive on a single gpu.\nTo add, it handles anything below 4k with no overclocking no problem at all every game 60fps and up.\n\nOverall a great card I love it does exactly what I want and more.\nManaged to preorder from Amazon at the $699 price (of course) and shipping was surprisingly fast.\n\nPros:\n-Great for rendering, video editing and 3D software\n-Amazing cooler design\n-Very easy to install\n-Sleek design\n\nCons:\n-None coming from a GTX 745"}, {"title": "GTX 1080 vs GTX 770 SC", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2016", "text": "I was able to order this card from Amazon Prime when it was available, and so paid MSRP.

I was mostly playing Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 1440P, though my older i7-4930k OCed to 4.2GHZ appeared to be a bit of a bottleneck for the card.\nNoise levels were pretty much inaudible.

This is a night and day difference from my older GTX 970 that sounded like it was going to explode, even after a thorough cleaning and new thermal paste was applied.\nAesthetics\nI'll be honest, as vain as it is, this was one of the main selling points for the card for me. There are so few high-end graphics cards that are white. Everything seems to be dark colors. This one fit the color scheme of my case great. The lighting of the Gigabyte text is a little dim, but overall still noticeable.\nBuild Quality\nNothing on the card felt cheap when I was unboxing it and installing it into my case. The back plate felt rigid and the shroud didn't feel flimsy. Nothing arrived damaged and the overall packing of the card was good. Everything pretty much worked out of the box.

It is a $500 dollar GPU. When it comes to PCs money literally buys performance. Especially in terms of CPU and GPU. So it performs amazingly in everything I have played.\n\nMy PC Hardware:\nCPU: i7-4790k.\nGPU: This one?.\nRAM: Kingston HyperX 2x4GB.\nSSD: Samsung 850 EVO 120GB for Operating System (Win 10 64bit) and Apps.\nHDD: 1TB Western Digital Green for games (and videos I record).\n\nCall Of Duty: Advanced Warfare; This game runs amazingly at max settings excluding super sampling. There does not seem to be a noticeable difference with super sampling on. I see about 90FPS all the time during gameplay no matter what is going on in Campaign. In multiplayer the framerate is well over 100FPS with now stutter or slowdown.\n\nSkyrim; The game destroys skyrim. Okay that is expected. BUT it also runs rock solid 60FPS with ENB mod and Many many other graphical and physics mods active. The only Mods that hurt the framerate are those ridiculous grass mods. That drops the FPS around 40 sometimes which is a bit disorienting when in combat. Other than that it will handle any mod you throw at it with ease as far as I have seen.\n\nTomb Raider (2013); Runs 60 FPS MAX with 2xSSAA (4xSSAA is just weirdly demanding. There is still plenty of VRAM left, system RAM, and I have a i7-4790k so i seriously do not understand what the problem is with 4xSSAA). The only time the game drops frames is during cutscenes when the camera gets close to Lara's Hair when TressFX is on. Other than that I have played through the entire game and noticed no other performance problems. You can check out a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP5C6aYIkik You will notice the only time it drops frames is when the camera gets close to her hair.\n\nFirestrike Demo: Scored 14,214 for Graphics Score. 11,895 for Overall Score. (Better than 87% of results it says)\n\nNow I do not know the power draw and all of those super specific kind of things but it only has 2 6pin power connectors which should tell you it is very power efficient for how powerful it is.\n\nThe default fan profile is really quite and keeps the card from killing itself (along with throttling back).\n\nMy card boost up to 1380MHz after GPU Boost 2.0 does its thing. I have tried lightly overclocking the card's GPU which worked fine but caused coil whine. I fixed the coil whine by setting the card back to default values then simply stressing it out with games and benchmarks for a little while. That method has worked for me but I would caution against OC the card further. I have since left my card at stock. (I will probably overclock it again anyway, I am weird like that lol).\n\nI tried bumping the RAM speed up a little. All i can see for this is do not do it lol. I do not know why but my card threw a fit and the graphics driver crashed. A LOT of reviewers of the base model 980 and all the 3rd party derivatives bumped the RAM speed up to a woping 7010MHz (10 from the base 7000MHz) and left it there. This card as you probably saw in the specs list Some said it was because of the way that power is allocated on this series (900) cards that OC the ram would take power away from the core so they just put all the OC effort into the Core. I think it is for a different reason but again I cannot be for sure.\n\nThe moral of the story is this card can handle pretty much anything @1080p you can throw at it. And it looks nice....really nice. It is pretty. It is quite at base fan profile like all the other cards with this cooler. If you have the money for this and not the 980ti/Fury X i would recommend it."}, {"title": "980s Overall Experience.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2015", "text": "Do you hate options menus? Do you like graphical fidelity? Do you value performance ratings over price/performance ratios without going to extremes? Then the GTX 980 is the perfect choice for you.\nIt's no question that the GTX 970 has a better price/performance ratio and you'll be able to pick one up for just at 200$ less, and if your budget can't handle the increased price of the GTX 980; you're not missing all too much. Realistically from what I've seen, the GTX 980 performs about 10-20% better, which isn't enough for many to justify 200$.\nLikewise, the GTX 980 is to the Titan X what the 970 is to the 980. For another 500$, twice the price of the 980, you can have a Titan X and 20-30% better performance. I, myself, opted for a dual SLI 980 build rather than a single Titan X build. SLI 980s performs a good bit better than a single Titan X and cost about 100$ more. With DirectX12 coming out soon, SLI is a smarter idea than ever due to SLI scaling. Currently, dual-GPU configs realistically only run at 160-170% the performance of a single card. DirectX12 aims to make that 200% in addition to the massive performance tweaks. With dual 980s already outperforming a single Titan X, it was a no brainer to me to go for the 980s.\nFor those worried about the 980 only having 4GB of VRAM (and planning to SLI), don't. DirectX12 is said to also add together VRAM instead of limit it to the maximum of one card. This means that a dual 980 build will have 8GB of usable VRAM - plenty for 1440p or 4k. At 4k, Shadows of Mordor on maximum settings with the ultra texture pack only uses 6.5GB. Shadows of Mordor is an extreme example, however, as most games don't even come close to touching 4GB, even at 4k.\n\nAll of that said, you really don't need to opt for SLI with the 980. Unless you're trying to future proof for a while or plan to play in 4k in everything that has it as an option, it's unnecessary. One single 980 very, very easily gets 60FPS at 1080p max settings. The same can be said for 1440p, you'll rarely if ever see less than 60FPS at max settings. Even at 4k, you'll generally have over 30FPS.\n\nI'm not a fan of overclocking generally because I don't trust my own ability not to destroy it; thankfully, EVGA has one of the highest stock clocks of the 980. I can safely have an overclock done by professionals without having to worry about my warranty. Additionally, EVGA's cooler design is very well done. The ACX 2.0 design acts as an intake rather than an exhaust and seems to work very well. Only with kboost on for extended periods of time have I come close to breaking 70 Celsius (with fans set to maximum). That said, unless you're benchmarking or doing something extreme like that; you'll never, ever hear your fans. In fact, on the stock fan config, the fans won't turn on until they reach 50 degrees Celsius. On maximum, however, they are quite loud. Playing Shadows of Mordor at 4k on maximum settings, the fans are barely at half speed and still rather quiet; though I'm not the type to care about how loud fans are.\n\nI'm very happy with my 980s and I'd recommend them to anyone with a similar budget; but for those who prefer to save 200$ or 400$ in an SLI build, the 970 is a worthy choice as well."}, {"title": "Awesome Video Card + Awesome Manufacturer", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2015", "text": "I'm not going to write a very long review because you can find the specifications and benchmarks of this card on nearly every major tech website. Instead I'll focus on what separates EVGA and this card from other manufacturers succinctly. EVGA is one of those rare manufacturers that hasn't outsourced it's support so if you're in the USA and have an issue with your video card at 2 am, you can call their 24/7 tech support and be assured someone will pick up on the other end.\n\nMy experience with their warranty service has been stellar and beyond what most companies do. For example, I previously purchased a pair of GTX Titans and after a year, one of them died on me. I used EVGA's online RMA system and since I purchased their advanced RMA warranty, they cross shipped me another one and I had a replacement in two days. Prior to that, I had an EVGA GTX 680 that had a broken component on it (purchased it like that used from someone else). I sent pictures of this to EVGA and asked if it could be repaired, even if I had to pay. To my astonishment, they simply said, \"send it in to us and we'll either fix it or send you another one\". Sure enough, a few days later after they got it, I checked the online system and a replacement had been issued. How can you beat that kind of service?\n\nNow as far as the EVGA GTX 980 ACX 2.0, I bought 2 of these in SLI and run them in an NZXT H440 case which is famous for poor airflow. However, despite that, these bad boys overclock to 1520 MHz core on stock voltage (1.206v) with +400 on the memory and they don't even flinch. Temperatures are also really good, GPU 1 is 78C max after hours of gameplay and GPU2 is 68-70C max. Fans never rev to 100% either, GPU 1 maxes at 75% and GPU2 at 65% using EVGA Precision to control them. ASIC quality for mine were both 75-76% so I lucked out there.\n\nSo the price is good, the performance is fantastic (they destroy my Titans when comparing both OC'd) and the operating temperature is really good. I can't really think of any cons associated with this video card and especially EVGA. If you're in the market for a new video card, go for the EVGA GTX 980, you won't regret it.\n\nUPDATE: 2/23/15\n\nI took one star off because I recently learned EVGA requires people who purchase these cards to register them within 14 days of the card's *purchase date* (not shipped or received) in order to qualify for their Step-Up program. If you miss it even by 1 day, well then too bad because they won't budge. Instead, if you want Step-Up, they penalize you by forcing you to buy their 5 year extended warranty for $30/card. In my case, that would be $60 and all for simply missing the registration date by a few days. It's obviously a way for the company to earn extra money but after already giving them $550+, you'd think they'd just make exceptions and let it slide or better yet allow customers to register for Step-Up for the entire 90 day period. Normally I recommend EVGA products and services to others without hesitation but based on principle, I will strongly consider competing brands the next time I buy $1100+ worth of video cards."}, {"title": "4K Dreams?

I'd watched all the professional youtube videos about 4K Gaming and seen people running games at 4K on 1 980. And many games 4-5 year old games do just fine at settings that might not be Ultra, but decent enough to give you that high end gaming experience you're looking for on a PC. The multiplayer populars such as League of Legends, Dota 2, Counter Strike, and even Battlefield 4, can push at 4K on the 980 at High settings, at 60 fps and higher. But the trouble comes when we talk about AAA Game Titles such as Witcher 3 (Yeah, even with the Hair FX turned off), Far Cry, or even high end graphics games like Evolve.\n\nI'd go into details, but I'm not a professional reviewer or a spec nerd, I consider myself knowledgeable enough to tell you the honest truth about what to expect. For a modest gamer, this card will definitely be decent for you at 1080 or 1440p, without question. If you don't feel like going to 4K, don't worry, one of these cards will be future proof for at least 5 years. But if you're that kind of person who just has a dire need to be ahead of the game.. this card is dwarfed by the 980 Ti, which stands to be the card which will be able to keep up the fight for some time.\n\nFor those in the GTX 500 Series, this card will seem like a huge leap, you'll notice the difference and by all means be satisfied. But if you're a 700 Series guy, the real improvements found in this card are its power usage which you'll notice is significantly less. EVGA's styling of this card is very good from a profile angle, and I haven't had many complaints except for the occasional screen glitch here or there, which I personally think has more to do with my monitor than it does actual issues with the card itself.\n\nRemember, if you have a monitor that is outdated, the card won't make it more awesome, and most cases with vsync off, will make you realize how painful your refresh rate on your monitor really is (especially if coming from the 500 Series). This card is almost ideal with a high end 1440p gaming monitor like the Asus RoG Swift PG278Q or another 120-144Hz monitor that can really give you the experience of those extra frames so you can do something with it.\n\nOverall I like it, but since I'm kind of obsessed with pushing the limits, this card isn't for me.

I started with an R9-280, but it couldn't quite keep up with me, so I tried the R9-290. It was a good card, but it liked to run hot, and I felt like the performance was not as strong as it should be. I considered the R9-290x, but it wasn't enough of a boost to justify the change. I also considered the R9-295x.\n\nThe problem with the R9-295x is it's basically a crossfired card. The problem with crossfire (I tried it with 2 r9-290s), is it gives terrible micro stuttering (and BSOD too!). I can't abide micro stuttering or tearing at all. It's like nails on a chalkboard to me.\n\nAfter looking far and wide for the strongest single GPU card, all the benchmarks led me here, to the GTX980. The only problem is the price is a little high. Okay, it's a lot high, so I was expecting a lot of performance per buck. I did some initial benchmarking with the card against the R9290, and I was surprised at how well... the r9-290 kept up. I actually wanted the GTX980 to destroy the R9-290. After all, the R9-290 is at a price point of around $250 to $300 bucks. So the GTX980 being twice as much at $550, I expected twice as much power. Not so.\n\nThat is not to say the GTX980 is not an amazing card. It is. And it is certainly better than the R9-290, but it is not incredibly, unbelievably better. It's about... 20% better. But where this card really shines is in a few different places.\n\nFirst, power usage and heat output. This card is probably 33% cooler than an AMD card, and that's a big plus. It means I don't have to worry about it overheating and can just get my game on.\n\nSecond, I have also found it handles memory better, especially with games with high textures, like modding some games to death with 4k textures. It doesn't complain about it like a little girl. (i.e. crashing or black textures)\n\nThird, and most importantly, it runs much smoother than the R9290. This is a measurement that you don't see on benchmarks, but this card just gives consistent performance. And what I'm referring to here is dropping frames. You can run through a crowded street, and maybe your FPS will drop, but it does so consistently. 60...55...50...45...50...55...60. With the R9290, it's like 60...10...40...50...30...10...60. It jumps all over the map! It's annoying. But the GTX980 is just smooth.\n\nAll and all, this is a 5 Star card, and I would buy it again. But to be fair, check your expectations at the door, and if you want something with similar performance but for a whole lot less, wander over the AMD camp. They have cookies. Nvidia has the cake :P\n\nPS Thumbs up for EVGA quality too!"}, {"title": "Absolutely phenomenal card - A Skyrim Modders Dream", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2015", "text": "Absolutely phenomenal card. I upgraded to this from an EVGA GTX 680 2GB and the difference is immediately noticeable. I run a very very heavily modded version of Skyrim that I used to get around 35-50 FPS with the performance RealVision ENB. With this card, I get 60fps everywhere (with the full RealVision ENB) with only the occasional dips in extremely populated or vegetated areas. I was also able to add 5 new graphical mods to Skyrim such as the famous FPS hungry \"grass fields\" mod, 4k texture replacers, and a few others, and I barely notice it at all in my frame rate. You know those absolutely insane screenshots you see of modded Skyrim? A lot of the time those shots have graphical settings so high that the game is actually unplayable, and that fidelity is only used for screenshots before the player turns down the graphics a little to actually play. Well this card can actually PLAY the game at the fidelity you see those screen caps at. This week I am going to test out Far Cry 4, Bio-shock Infinite, and both of the Metro games on Ultra with this beast. I have no doubt in my mind this thing will run smooth as butter on those titles.\n\nWhen should you upgrade?:\nIf you currently have a 600 series card or below, then I recommend picking this (or the 970) card up as it is definitely a worthy upgrade for the price. If you have a Titan, or 780/780ti then I recommend just holding off a little bit until the next generation of card is released. Simply because it might not be that big of a leap from the 780ti to this in terms of cost justification (unless you can sell your 780 to make up a portion of the cost of this of course, which is what I did with my 680).\n\nNoise:\nThis card is quiet as can be. with the ACX 2.0 design the fans don't even spin up until you need them (by design) and when they do you don't hear them at all.\nUPDATE on coil while. I DID end up experiencing slight coil whine while playing high intensity games. I found out this was coming from my PSU and not my new 980. Once I upgraded fron a 700w to a gold rated 800w PSU, the whine went away.\n\nSize:\nThis card is just as long as my GTX 680. But the 980 is actually thinner due to my 680 having a blower fan shroud and this having standard fin fans.\n\nIn the end, this card is great, I highly recommend it, and I wish I wasn't at work right now or I'd be home slaying dragons while counting the bugs on the rocks in Skyrim."}, {"title": "Running this card since 2015", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2022", "text": "I have been running this card daily between a few people since 2015, 7 years later it is still working like i first bought it despite showing its age in newer games over the past few years.\n\nthe use i have got out of this card has probably made it my best tech purchase ever - it's been through multiple motherboards, cpus (originally started w/ sandy bridge 2500k,) and setups and now has a final home in a HTPC/server paired with a 3900X until its end of days.\n\nNowadays i can't recommend this card for obvious reasons - the main being its age and power draw//performance as there are better options.

This card allows me to not only view in simply amazing quality but aswell as being able to handle it! with the purchase of this card came a free game download from uplay, so i chose far cry 4. the other two options were \"the crew\" & \"assassins creed: the unity(I think)\" I was able to play far cry 4 on ultra settings with no problem. Some wouldnt consider minecraft an actual intense game, but I played a yogscast complete pack which is heavily modded & it makes you lag extremely bad. with this card (& of course alot of ram & a nice pcu) I was able to get 300fps according to the game, without overclocking anything of course. So this card is amazing, but the only issue I have is the heat this thing creates. This thing can get pretty hot. especially when i loaded up far cry 4 the card shot from ~40c (average temperature) to 70c within a few minutes. Now, you do have the option to set up your own fan profile for the card, which I did. I had to turn the fan to I think around 60-70% speed for the temperature to sit around 60c.

Im sure you could let the fan sit at 100% speed and probably have the temps down to 45-50c but I just dont know if i can trust the fans spinning that fast for multiple hours without something wrong happening. aswell, theyre really loud at high speeds.

If for some reason you want this exact card know that it can be purchased for $350-400 new as of February 2020 on eBay. However, at that price you can purchase a 5700 XT which has 15% more power. The current listing price of $800 is absurd and shouldn't even be considered unless you like flushing your hard earned money down the toilet.\n\nFor 1080p 100-144+ FPS or 1440p 60-90 FPS gaming, with a mix of high and ultra settings, and the occasional medium setting (curse you Volumetric Clouds in AC Odyssey) this card performed outstanding. However getting it there took a few tweaks. The biggest problem I had with this graphics card was with the way the card was manufactured. The factory thermal pad in it didn't make full contact with all of the VRM so some of the heat produced wasn't properly pulled into the heat sink as a result the card would throttle and never reach the clocks that ASUS listed. I fixed this by replacing the thermal pad with one that properly covered the VRM. After that undervolting the card and overclocking the HBM2 memory I was able to get close to a 15% boost in performance. I don't know how wide spread of a problem the thermal pads are with Strix Vega 64 cards, but at the time googling a fix I found several people on forums also having the same issue.\n\nI bought this card early 2018 and while Vega wasn't a GTX 1080 killer as rumored, I have been pleased with it even with the problems I've encountered. That said, I have bought just Strix cards for last few GPU cycles and have to say for the 1-3% boost in performance with ASUS cards they are not worth the price premium, if price to performance is your main drive for purchasing a graphics card.\n\nIf this was late 2017 early 2018 I would say go ahead and buy the card, but with so many much better options in 2020 you really should look at something else."}, {"title": "Save you money...", "rating": "3", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2018", "text": "Factory overclocked my @ss! I have done EXTENSIVE testing on this card and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this card is NOT worth the money! The whole issue stems from the fact that the Vega 64 chips dynamically adjust their clocks on the fly. I can't seem to hit the advertised clocks on this card as the chip automatically throttles itself down. 1350-1520MHz clocks is ALL I EVER get out of this card no matter the use. My Vive VR games will stutter and glitch as this card is running WELL below it's advertised speeds. And it's not a heat/fan issue. The card never gets above 76. Fan never goes above 55%. The fan will max out at 75% though. So if your case fans aren't doing their job, expect the card to NEVER use 100% fans.\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad card. Runs circles around my Fury X. But I've NEVER had a card flat out refuse to hit it's advertised speeds. Sure, with Chrome it will hit max clocks. But not in a single 3D application...you know, the whole reason you bought the d@mn thing in the first place. I've tried Wattman, MSI Afterburner, ASUS AI Suite, you name it. I've scoured the internet and REDDIT forums for answers. I can NOT get this card to do what it's advertised to do in a video game! If this is the direction AMD is headed, I might have to start buying nVidia again...and I f'ing HATE nVidia!\n\nUPDATE: Finally got the card to hit 1600MHz or so. Had to install ASUS GPUTweak and manually set the fans to max speeds at lower temps. Then,. I hooked one of my PWM case fans to the pins on the back of the card and set the speeds for it to max out at about 45 Celsius. I also set my Corsair H115i AiO cooler to max speeds forcing as much hot air out of my case, and bringing in as much cool air as possible. Sounds like a wind turbine in my room now, but the card's temps stay around 55 Celsius which keeps my clock speeds a lot higher than before, thus making my games run faster. A lot of work to get it functioning correctly.

You can control the GPU color (if you're not using an ASUS mobo, which integrates all Aura devices) by downloading the Asus Aura software. It's a little more work to put the color values in from other software if you're doing matching, but it's a one-time thing.\n\nI have heard, and seen data that shows, that the card draws a lot of power.

I am getting similar framerates (to ideal CrossFire framerates with my old graphics cards and a 27\" 1440p non FreeSync monitor), without the hassle and side effects of CrossFire. A lot of newer and/or upcoming games do not support CrossFire or SLI. The smoothness of a single powerful card paired with adaptive sync is hard to beat, and now I can play the games that didn't support CrossFire with very high to maxed out settings with very smooth game play. This card is very large, larger than the Sapphire Tri-X's being replaced, but quiet and runs fairly cool (around 75 degrees C max after hours of gaming in a well ventilated case) for what it is (a power hungry Vega 64). If you are coming from a setup like mine, it will be a side grade as far as framerates on most well optimized CrossFire supported games, but without the CrossFire stutter, and an upgrade of framerates, pretty much doubled, on the games that don't support CrossFire, and you will only need two 8 pin power connectors instead of four. With or without FreeSync, you will enjoy very smooth gameplay on very high or maximum graphics settings at 1440p with this card. Whether you need to replace an aging graphics card setup, or want to build a new gaming rig with an AMD powered video card (or both), I highly recommend this graphics card, at a reasonable price ($599 was reasonable to me after waiting so long to buy an RX Vega 64 because of the pricing during the first half of 2018).

It worked, but there was some issue with the fan control. If the card turned on the fans, it would turn them on at 100% and was very loud. There was no mid-range, only ON or OFF at 100%, no matter the settings. Also, once the fans were turned on, it would not turn them back off without a reboot.

At first I was a little apprehensive about going to Radeon. I have owned a GTX 660 and GTX 680 and was very happy with the Nvidia cards. I wanted to upgrade as the GTX 680 was starting to show its age and performance in games was dipping (still playable at lower settings at 60 fps, but I like my games to be pretty). I did my research on the RX 480s and saw mixed reviews on the temperatures and performance from some of the launch models. I chose Asus Dual-Fan edition to hopefully combat the threat of rising temperatures. I am impressed with the way this card handles.\n\nI play a lot of RB6 Siege, Witcher 3, and Fallout 4. I'm able to max the settings at 1080p for these titles and play within 45-60 FPS (most of the times higher than that). The card itself never gets above 60 degrees celcius even when OC'd, which is not very necessary in most scenarios.\n\nI docked one star due to the fact that the Radeon software suite and GPU Tweak tool are just plain aweful compared to the GeForce Experience suite. Wattman is tough to navigate and the various settings are confusing and conflict with in-game graphical settings. I prefer to use MSI Afterburner for any OC needs. Also, another reason for the 4/5 is the noise this card makes when the fans operate at 70% and higher. Sounds like a hair dryer in my machine. There have also been times when the card is showing 30-40 degrees and the fans kick in to 100% for a few seconds...scaring the crap out of me.\n\nI highly recommend this card to anyone who has a budget of ~$200.

Asus set the max temperature for throttling to 75C unlike most cards which throttle around 85C so it will throttle at least once every minute creating terrible stuttering.

In my experience a carefully tuned overclock and custom fan curve are absolutely necessary to get all of this card's potential.\nOnce tuned correctly this is a very good card for gaming at 1080p, this can max out any game I throw at it and fly through with 60+ frame rates in pretty much every game I own.\nTo sum things up, this card has a lot of potential but it takes a little bit of patience and time to get everything you can out of it.\nIf you have experience overclocking graphics cards and have the time to tweak this to make it work then this is a great card.\nIf you are more hands off and just want things to work I would not recommend this card, there are other RX470s that do not share the problems that this one carries and would be much more enjoyable for alot of people.\nI have gotten to know this card pretty well and honestly enjoy it a lot, it could be that my card is unique and most people will have none of the problems that I've had, but based on my experience I would urge you to be cautious about this card.

The card will throttle when it goes over 75\u00b0C. This is far too low of a temperature. It drops the card's speed down to 300mhz and your games will drop down to 10fps.\n2. The card will overheat with any sort of overclocking. Don't listen to the other reviews here about needing to overclock it to get it to run well. It WILL overheat and it WILL throttle, unless you're liquid cooling maybe.\n3. When you get the card, just run it on the \"gaming\" setting to test it. If you have problems with throttling then either increase the fan speed or underclock it a little bit. It sucks but that's the best way to get it to run stably.\n4.

It sure did. The throttling issue is now gone. In it's place is a complete system shut-down. Once under heavy load the computer will just auto shut-off. I initially suspected it was a problem with my PSU. After replacing that, and the problem still persisting, I swapped out the GPU and voila, problem solved. The GPU I switched it out to has HIGHER power requirements.\n\nASUS is flailing about trying to fix their poor engineering, and we are paying the price. This card is going back.

In order to reach it's advertised 1206 MHz core clock, you'll have to do some quick and easy tuning to the card, although it doesn't help in every situation.\n\nDue to ASUS limiting the GPU's default voltage, you'll have to go into WattMan settings and adjust the Power Limit (%) slider to at least 15%; allowing the GPU to reach its 1206 MHz clock under load. For some reason, doing so brought instability and crashing while playing Overwatch. This seems to be a problem on Overwatch's side, although I can't be certain that this won't persist in other titles as well.\n\nSo, at the end of the day this GPU will probably play your games well, and will do so quietly. Unfortunately, tweaking the settings in order to get the advertised performance that you paid for may not work in your favor. I'd highly recommend going for another another Rx 470, such as the MSI Gaming version for $10 more."}, {"title": "Amazing 1080p Card!", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2016", "text": "I am loving this card!

However, having owned it for about a week now and having paid the MSRP I will not just give it a 1 star just for the jacked up prices as others have already done so to ward people away from overspending.\n\nThis card is an absolute beast in almost all aspects. I upgraded from an SLI GTX 970 and its outperforming those by far. I play on a 1440p monitor and its absolutely OVERKILL at that resolution. 60+ FPS on all games highest settings, (currently playing Overwatch, Warhammer, Witcher 3, GTA V) The reason I upgraded is because with the two 970 SLI I couldn't take full advantage of my 1440p monitor and I plan on doing future upgrades to 4k as well as a second build.\n\nThe Pascal Architecture seems to be a wonderful change. I don't know how it works but while I'm playing games at 1440p max settings, the card flickers between 70-71C after hours of gaming(WHICH IS AWESOME!), and despite playing in a hot room when I want to save money on the electric bill and keep the AC off. I planned to put a water block on it and keep it that much cooler before receiving the card but right now there's no need for it. Playing at the resolutions and settings I'm at. As for 4k I have no personal experience but check out reviewers on youtube. It seems that this card at 4k resolution is playing games such as Doom at the high settings at about 40-55 fp. However the temps with the Founders Edition seem to be into the low-mid 80'sC , at least from what I've read and seen. Still a good look for future video cards.\n\nThe temps are also while the GPU is overclocked to 2025Mhz Core clock and 5500 Memory Clock, I may be able to achieve 2.1k Mhz but haven't been able to thus far. The boost clock says into the 1700's Mhz but mine definitely boost into the 1800Mhz on it's own, for those who don't overclock. Which brings me to my next point. 2k+ Mhz, which is pretty awesome and easy to achieve with this card. From what I've read the community is trying to achieve over 2.1Mhz Core clock but even with the custom cooled cards they haven't been able to. (At least from what I've read! I could be wrong as I haven't possibly seen or read everything!) But 2k Mhz is still something to be happy with in my opinion. Again these temps are with these clocks at 1440 p resolution.\n\nThe Founders Edition looks beautiful. I like the look but some may be more inclined with a custom cooled card that matches their rig better. This was asked before but being sold from Zotac, the card does not have Zotac logos or colors on it from what I've seen. If it does then it really hidden. The 8pin power connector that came with this Zotac edition was yellow hoever. Not sure if that's the standard or just Zotac. The FE GTX 1080 is only an 8 pin power connector however I haven't seen too much evidence of it being an issue. Also there is a backplate included on the card. At first I was disappointed that it was plastic. However the card is pretty heavy at least compared to my 970s and a metal backplate may have made it heavier.\n\nNow onto the bad. The temps are wonderful on this card (not a high 4k settings) however the fan is LOUD at the higher fan speeds. And I mean L-O-U-D. This doesn't bother me as I usually have my headset on, speakers playing music, and I personally am able to drown the sound out so it doesn't bother me. But for people who this matters to I assure you that it will bother you because again it is LOUD. If this is a big deal to you I'd recommend looking at a custom cooled version of the card.\n\nThe biggest issue I had and I've seen on some forums is its compatibility with Windows 10. When I first put the card to use, the PC recognized it, however I kept getting an issue saying that the GPU drivers were not compatible with my version of Windows 10. After a few hours of frustration and research I found that my Windows didn't update to the version 1151 when the update was put out a few months ago. So if you're on Windows 10 you will have to update to that version if you haven't already or the drivers won't work!\n\nAt 1080p and 1440p this card is overkill. At 4k this is still a beast from what I've read and seen just worry about the temps. It was worth the price of $700 for me at least. Look to the customed cooled cards if they're available if you want for sure but as far as performance it seems that they perform similarly despite the added cooling. You may even wait for a possible gtx 1080 ti if that comes out this year. Just know you won't go wrong with this card!. Hope this helps someone!"}, {"title": "ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1080 AMP!

(Seasonic Prime 850W PSU, dead silent, Corsair ML140 fans set to 800RPM, dead silent) So when I changed out these fans I noticed that this card does have an extremely annoying problem which may or may not bother some users, but at idle (under 30% load or so) the fans will spin up hard (much more than necessary) and stop in a cycle which is extremely annoying. This is easily fixed with a custom fan profile, I like MSI: Afterburner so I use that. You MUST keep the fans at least at 30% to keep the spin up cycle from happening. Mine is set to be at 30% until 39C and then it spins up at the same percentile as the degree number. With the profile set like that my card very rarely goes over 55C and is barely audible with headphones on, without phones it gets a little annoying. The fans ARE NOT audible until about 50% or so, if you can manage to keep the fans speeds under that level without the temp going over 65C you will be very happy.\n\nThe second, and only real issue is that this card is MASSIVE, it WILL require you to buy or rig a brace, there is a risk of damaging the PCI-e slot on your motherboard without it.\n\nAll that being said this card is fantastic and I have not had a single major problem with it so far, it runs almost everything at maxed out settings at 3440x1440 @100Hz resolution, save extremely GPU heavy games, but that speaks more of the chip and the overclock than anything.\n\nThe RGB lighting is limited but very nice and the monster card adds a little bit of awe to my rig.\nThe yellow stripe is a huge distraction from my otherwise Blue, Black, and Silver scheme.\n\nAs much as I love Zotac and the AMP! Extreme edition I am not 100% sure I will upgrading to the 1080 Ti version if these problems persist in the 1080 Ti AE, other manufacturers seemed to have step up their game significantly and I think I would sacrifice 1-3 fps for a card that will run cooler and quieter, even if it doesn't look as great in my rig.

They are heavy, have a stylized look with glowing lights and the construction is top notch. The card is somewhere in the middle when it comes to noise from the fan, and it is a single blower fan. This is totally fine for most players who aren't overclocking. I personally put this card in a small Mini ITX case and have no plans for overclocking with such limited space for cooling. You can expect this card to throttle as most modern graphics cards are tuned to throttling at certain temps, so overheating should be difficult on the 1080 unless your wiring and air ventilation is extremely poor.\n\nNvidia has generally very easy software to install to manage the card drivers, and they'll also give you their recommended settings for the games you have installed on your PC. I find this feature doesn't work all of the time. Nvidia's driver stability from the 970 to the 1080 has largely been a positive experience, compared to the AMD cards before it. You pay a premium but get a premium experience in return.\n\nPerformance of the card is so good that it's largely dependent on the quality of the PC developer if you're going to crush the settings. World of Warcraft on Ultra drops to 40FPS, but Witcher 3 runs at 144fps or higher if I uncapped it at 1080p. Basically the skies the limit and software optimization now needs to catch up with Pascal's new architecture. The 1080 is absolutely great with Oculus Rift games, including Elite Dangerous, which runs steady at 90FPS with VR settings on high (and some simple supersampling tricks). If you're taking VR seriously, the 1080 is probably right where you want to be for demanding games. Lastly it should be future proof, as in you should easily have this card for 2 years without feeling an urge to go out and upgrade. Graphics enhancements are slowing down, so I expect improvements to be pretty gradual going forward.\n\nThis is the card for VR/1440p monitors, but I'm still not convinced anything is really capable of running 4k at the performance I want. I don't think 4K gaming is really going to be up to my standards for another 2 years or so.\n\nSo yes, this is highly recommended. It's insanely expensive, but it's a large jump and you'll have it for a long time in computer gamer years."}, {"title": "Excellent. PROs", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2016", "text": "Excellent.\n\nPROs:\nSuper fast our of the box. If you do not need to \"compete\" for OC, you don t really need to touch this card at all. It delivers outstanding performance just after install. No need for special knowledge, is a real \"Plug 'n Play\"\nIn regard of OC I made a few tests and more about it later. Stock is 2075 on core. So far I was able to get it steady at 2122 but is not the cap yet, I could push it forward, just don t know if i really wanna do it :)\n\nCONs:\nIt is only on the OC software. Firestorm is really behind Afterburner. Yoou need it mostly for the lights settings, but then fortunately, Afterburner can perfectly work on setting the card. I didn t try OC using AB but i use AB to set a custom dynamic range for the fans, which works way better than the same option on Firestorm.\nCard is HUGE, not everyone can possibly set it in SLI, need to check your MB slots first to ensure they have the correct distance\nIt is expensive, but you get what you pay for.\n\nOTHERS:\nI guess I was lucky on the OC lottery. This card seems to be very OCable. However you have to monitor carefully what you are doing. Around 54 degrees it will throttle down and between 49 and 54 degrees it may throttle down because of voltage, therefore you need to add a bit of a juice there. So far I scored a 3029 on Heaven 4 and I am REALLY satisfied.\nIf you are crazy enough to get a Liquid cooler for this thing and then be able to keep it below 53 degrees, this thing can really hit the Sky. However, if you wanna do that, you don t need to get this card, a Founder Edition would already work for you, considering you have to apply a liquid cooler on it.\n\nIt is expensive, my previous card died prematurely, i was hoping to get to a 1080 Ti but didnt make it. I think this is the closest thing I could get to a future Ti. I do not know when the Ti will be available, i know it will be better than this but I don t think by too much (for this card comparison) so, if you have the budget, just get it."}, {"title": "The ArcticStrorm is an absolute gorgeous BEAST!", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2017", "text": "First of all this is my first ZOTAC product but given their good track record, I wasn't at all hesitant. I usually like to add my own aftermarket watercooling blocks as about 90% of my system is EKWB. But I found this on sale over Christmas so I sold my R9 Fury X with a custom EK waterblock and ordered this to replace it. My standards for quality components and how I want them to look is pretty high. Having said that, Let me tell you that the pictures come nowhere near doing this thing justice. It is absolutely stunning in person and the craftsmanship more than meets my standards. And when I say in the title that its a Beast,. this thing can overclock like crazy and yes it also weighs a TON so be prepared to deal with it sagging. I am running a FurMark stress test in the background as I am typing this review. I have it at +200 Core clock and +1000 Memory clock and the temps are maxing out at 48c.. yeah.. 48c. Thats NUTS! I can push the Core clock +100 further but at minimal performance gain so why bother. This GPU is everything I had hoped for. I have always considered myself a bargain shopper with my PC but still wanting to get top end components. I usually wait 6 months plus till prices come down etc. I did what most AMD GPU fans did and waited, and waited, and waited for RX VEGA. Of course it turned out to be a flop and way overpriced. So I started to shop around for GTX 1070s and 1080s because they seemed like the best options. Sure not everyone has that $500+ GPU budget and I usually don't give in either. But I have to say that after swallowing hard and spending the big money it is so worth it.

I run custom settings but for the most part everything on ultra or high, I do not use any AA settings and keep view distance and detail @ #7. The card get's a solid 52-60 FPS with v-sync on to prevent over 60fps as the screen only runs 4x4x4 Chroma and 60hz with A HDMI (this screen has no display port) using HDMI cable. I run resolution in 4k otherwise this card powerfully blazes through 1080P paired with Intels I7 4790k. I'm running a Alphacool custom loop with one 60mm thick 360mm rad, and dual Alphacool VP655 pumps. The Articstorm card runs stable, smooth and never even gets as hot as the CPU for the most part.\n\n*Reason I knocked stars*\n1. I do not like Zotac's software, the program you use to control the LED's and over clocking. It has the options and functions but forgive me for saying so it's not visually appealing to me what so ever.\n\n2. When I originally got the card all of the LED colors work but not all of them it's a strange issue.\n-Red Works\n-Yellow Works\n-Green Works\n-Light Blue ( doesn't work, it just illuminates green.)\n-Dark Blue (doesn't work, it sometimes will flicker on but for most part I get no color at all)\n-Pink (doesn't actually turn pink just stays solid red, like the 1st red option on spectra)\n-White (works, but doesn't because it's actually turning on something in between green/yellow)\n\nThe spectra really bugs me, I paid over $750 dollars and the one color I really liked that matches my system (blue) doesn't work. I've tried contacting Zotac and they said try reinstalling firestorm. But I know it's obviously an issue specific to certain colors and the card needs repair. Unfortunately it's my only system and they don't offer a quick service to repair the card in a timely manner. I'd be without a system for weeks or months and for me that's not an option.\n\nSo the card is working well it self, but having the spectra fail, and not having a system in place for cross shipping, or a faster warranty repair solution I may not invest in Zotac again."}, {"title": "Reverted AMD fan - this new GTX 1080 is BEAST.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2016", "text": "After an exhaustive search online - I finally came across this Zotac GTX 1080 in stock. I was not real sure about the Zotac brand as I have\nalways been a loyal EVGA fan. Well since I needed this video card to complete my new PC build I went ahead and jumped on this opportunity. I have had this card installed now for 3 days and cannot be happier about the speed and performance of this Founders Edition card. Just last night I downloaded and installed MSI AfterBurner Beta software and was able to get a very stable overclock on this card at 2087mghz. I then played the new Doom on max settings and this thing never dropped below 60fps. The temperatures never got over 74c and this card is a beast. I also put on some GTA V all on max settings and again this card doesn't even flinch at anything I throw at it. After having this card for a few days and being in the IT industry for 20yrs I can without a doubt refer family and friends that this card is worthy of all the hype. Yes I paid the extra $100 over MSRP to get my hands on this card early and I don't regret it at all. This card was worth every penny and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for the best video card to date in my opinion. Also to add I ran a Benchmark on this card right out of the box and I was getting 1911mghz which is well over the advertised base clock on the Reference cards.

Playing Doom 4K maxed on Ultra settings, and also been playing Battlefield 4 on Ultra @ 4K as well as Crysis on Ultra settings @ 4K. This card handles everything you throw it at. Also handles VR with my HTC Vive beautifully. No issues at all. This card is insane and I am so glad I got it. The card also looks great in my case. You can definitely get board partner cards for cheaper than this, but the Founder's Editions have been in stock more than the partner cards as of now and in my opinion look better. If you want a card sooner than later buy this card, but if you can wait I would definitely wait for a partner cards especially if you don't plan on overclocking at all since they tend to come with higher base frequencies.\n\nCurrent rig for reference:\n\nCPU: i7-5820k o/c 4.4Ghz @ 1.25v w/ Dark Rock Pro 3\nMOBO: MSI X99A Sli Plus\nRam: 4x4GB Corsair Vengeance LPX 15-17-17-35 DDR4-3000\nStorage: 1TB Samsung 850 Evo SSD\nVid card: Zotac GTX 1080 FE o/c 2050M Mhz Core - 5500Mhz Mem.\nPSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 850watt G2\nCase: Cooler Master HAF 912\nOS: Windows 10 Pro"}, {"title": "I don't think this is the best 1080!", "rating": "3", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2017", "text": "I regret this card!\nFirst of all, You should know this card has an issue: When this card has a load under 30% the fan will spin at full speed for 1 second and stop and will repeat the process a second later and you can hear the noise!

It's used for a bit of gaming (Kerbal Space Program runs wonderfully with all the highest detail settings on now) but mostly for GPU-based calculations on BOINC tasks.\n\nThe GPU computing part is the most important reason I went for this over the overclocked variety - some tasks are a but funny with overclocked GPU's. It runs 24/7 at as near to full capacity as I can make it. At that load, the fans on the card can't be heard over the PSU and CPU/RAM fans, so I'd say they're quiet enough for my purposes. In terms of real-world performance of the GPU for calculations, I have a PrimeGrid task for the Genfer19 project that's been running for over 6 days on the CPU (Xeon@3.5Ghz) but when run through the GPU they're taking 7,674-ish seconds on the GPU.\n\nWhen gaming the card runs at about 40% capacity and the fans hardly run at all.\n\nInstallation was a breeze - plug it in and switch on. After a couple of seconds I was at the desktop and ready to download the drivers from Nvidia's website. Even without the drivers loaded, I had 1920x1080 displays on both of my monitors, not sure what the experience would have been on Windows as I don't use it so YMMV.\n\nIn terms of electrical power, this card needs a six-pin connection from your power supply, so a properly rated power supply is a must. I'm running a 700W unit which is probably a bit more than I need for this, but you should check the requirements of the machine you're running.\n\nIf you're considering buying this card, be aware that it needs some space around it for airflow, and will take up two slots in your case, and two expansion slots in the backplane. I didn't check the physical size of the PCB against the space I had available and I've had to modify my case as a result. I'd also suggest that you make sure you've got some space around the PC for ventilation, as it draws quite a bit of power and your PSU will generate a bit more heat as a result.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this card."}, {"title": null, "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in France on June 26, 2021", "text": "tr\u00e8s bonne carte parfait pour le 1080p plus de 60 fps.

When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash.

If you haven't been keeping up with the nerdy-computer-guts market in the past five years or so, ASUS decided to stop crapping out sub-par laptops, and actually make some seriously good quality components. Nowadays, almost anything with ASUS on it has some serious love built into it, and though they're high-performance, the price tags tend to be fairly reasonable. ASUS GPUs also come with monitoring and on-the-fly profiling software that, while a little buggy on Win 8/10, is pretty nifty.\n\nI'm also surprised how cool this particular card stays. Right now, this card's in a air-cooled mid-tower, and still, after about 90 minutes of stress-testing, I can't seem to push my card past 60C. And since the oversized fans are dynamic, at idle or low load, you can barely hear the card at all. Same goes for the wattage requirements. I was a little worried before I upgraded my PSU, but the old PSU seems just content with it. Even when I play something with some serious requirements for a few hours, I'm not getting any heat or power spikes.\n\nThe Bad:\nOverclocking. Just... no. Keep it at recommended voltage, and less than %110 clock. Only one time I tried to benchmark the card at redline, and it was dropping frames like an art gallery in an earthquake. Eventually, the PC froze, and I had to hard reset. The small performance boost from OVing or OCing makes it pointless from all the HW errors. It wasn't from the heat, either. The entire time, I manually set the fans to full speed, and it never crept past 50C. It just doesn't like it.\n\nThe Ugly:\nFor %90 of the games in my library, the card runs like a champ. I was playing Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, and for the lulz, I turned off VSync and removed the FPS cap. It ran for about 60 seconds and then crashed. After some investigating, I found out it was trying to run the game at >1000 fps. Awesome.\n\nBut then there's there's the other %10. I tried to play GTA V on max settings, and it's just struggling to keep >30 fps. Same deal with MSG V. Running the Unigine Valley benchmark at max with the card's default, and I'm lucky if I can average 30. I was getting spikes at 40, and min was something like 12. I have to really tone down the textures and the anitaliasing to get >60 frames.\n\nI also got the 2GB version to save a little money. 2GB is just not enough. It's like putting a V12 supercharged engine on a go-kart transmission.\n\nThis is what I mean by \"awkward\". It's a little too overpowered if you're playing some casual games or an MMO. It's a little too underpowered to play something more demanding at max settings. That puts the 960 in this weird no man's land. If you want something to play LOL or TF2 with, save some money and go with an older 780. If you're trying to build a monster, shell out the extra $100 and get a 970 or 980 if you're not planning to SLI.\n\nBottom Line:\nBy no means can I call this a \"bad\" card. It's an ungraceful card. Most of the time, it'll outperform what I throw at it, but every once in a while, I have to go back and fiddle with the settings. I don't say I regret buying it, but I should have at least gotten the 4GB, and I think I can live with it until I decide to do an upgrade in the near future."}, {"title": "Step Up to Better Graphics!", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2015", "text": "I just purchased a 25\" Acer 2560 x 1440 monitor.\nAfter much research, I came up with this brand GTX 960.

With my ASrock X99M Fatal1ty board already purchased, I chose the former option.\nNow that story time is over, let's see how the card performs. As far as overclocking is concerned, I was able to manage 1350 MHz (offset of +59) on the core and maxed out the slider at 8200 MHz (offset +1000) on the VRAM. I set my custom fan profile to be silent all the way to 60C and started gaming away at good ol' 1080p. I already knew that cranking up the MSAA wasn't really an option, so I stuck with high settings for most all games except Bioshock Infinite, which I could manage 60 FPS on ultra. Even with a relatively puny 2GB of video RAM, I was able to play almost all other titles on high with very decent frame rates. Coming from a 750 Ti, this is good news. For those who want all that MSAA, however, I would recommend stepping up to the 4GB version or ponying up and getting the GTX 970 instead.\nAs I said in the title, value was my game for this card until my 5960X comes to my front door. Sure, I can't max out GTA V, but I didn't necessarily feel it was necessary to shell out more money for a card that I am going to replace in probably a year anyway.\nFor those who are still running panels with resolution lower than 1080p, I can't recommend this card enough.

This is their definite 1080p bang for your buck card. It's cool, quiet and performs much better than a reference design thanks to the higher clocks and custom cooling unit. I'd say the comparable card from team red would bet the R9 280x. This card beats the 280 in most games but the 280x is pretty neck and neck. So between the two it depends on whether you're looking for raw gaming performance, cuda support or OpenCL. I will say this card has played nearly any game I've thrown at it on Ultra minus multi-sampled anti-aliasing and kept above 60FPS. That is the key with this card though, unless you're playing a Source Engine game or Minecraft, you really need to turn the filters down. I don't play with MSAA unless it's a source game, and even then I turn AA off completely in most games. I run Skyrim at 1080p with over 120 mods, about 30 of which are graphics mods. That combined with RealVision ENB I'm still managing between 50 and 60FPS almost all the time. Games like Far Cry 4, Battlefield 4 and COD: AW all run well fast 60FPS as well. Far Cry 4 not being 100% optimized does need to be bumped down to Very High instead of Ultra to keep a steady 50 - 60FPS.

Most cards that have an output layout like this are fake and, seeing reviews from people saying it won't run DX11, I'm inclined to believe this isn't even a 6770 as those did run DX11. The listed clock speed is about 200mhz lower than the original cards which, at best, points to these being faulty cards flashed with a different BIOS to operate at a lower clock speed. HD 5770s and 6770s (same card with 2 names) also NEVER came with 4GB of VRAM.\n\nAgain, this points to this being a card with a fake BIOS. I've tested another faked GPU claiming to be a GTX 960 4GB and the card even reported itself as such to the computer. In actuality it was a GT640 with 1GB of VRAM. When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash.

When I purchased this product, Amazon guaranteed delivery on Sunday Feb. 6, 2022. On the 6th, I woke up to an email that it would be delayed until Monday the 7th. No problem, we had a blizzard and people have been digging out. BUT, it was delivered on Sunday and just left outside, in the freezing cold and snow, without me knowing or expecting it was going to happen. Luckily, a friend stopped in for five minutes, and by coincidence that's when the package was left in the cold and snow, so it wasn't there when he came up the porch, but it was there when he went down and my package got to me safely. The seller bears no responsibility for this, as it was fulfilled by Amazon, but for some reason, Amazon doesn't let us write reviews for the customer service, so here it is. You can do better, Amazon.\n\nAs for the product itself, it's not really as bad as my \"stars\" would suggest. It arrived in what appears to be brand new packaging. I can't find any evidence that the anti-static bag was ever opened before. I installed it in my aging Dell Inspiron 3700 (with an i5-8400, and 12GB of RAM) hooked it all up, turned it on, and after about 5 minutes of some installation process (at which time there WAS video) my screen automatically reverted to the display settings it had prior to the install, and it works just fine. I installed Nvidia GeForce and, after one more driver update it was over. The entire process was from start to finish was less than 20 minutes.\n\nThis was the first time I have ever installed a GPU, and I can only assume that that is EXACTLY how it is supposed to work. As for the value for money, NO GPU has a good value to money ratio. Crypto-miners and the pandemic have seen to that.\n\nAs for gaming, this just is NOT a card built to plays today's most advanced games. I got this card because PGA 2K21 can only track one profile at a time, so two people with two profiles need two copies of the game to track their stats in co-op. Now, my aging Dell could manage about 25 FPS in \"potato mode,\" a number that made it unplayable. With this card, on low settings (one step up from potato mode), this card and the i5 deliver 90FPS steadily at 1080p quality.\n\nThe problem there, is that 2K21 is really \"The Golf Club 3\" with 2K's marketing slapped on the box. As such, the entire install from Steam was just 6.6GB. And as every modern gamer knows, the 5-15GB game file size was lost to any game above the 'indie\" classification when the games went 4K. Which means that the game would have to still be in potato mode if 4K textures even existed in the files for processing.\n\nThe only other \"modern\" game I have on the Dell is Kerbal Space Program. And that, with low settings turned on, and the FPS locked to 80, this card and the i5 can get maintain a steady 60 in the assembly buildings and launchpad, and dropped into the 40 FPS range during the launches I tested. But that is normal. KSP can make even monster PC's cry for mercy if the user launches a big enough ship. The limitation there is far more CPU dependent than GPU dependent as the game tries to simulate physics, heat, and gravity calculations on hundreds of individual parts simultaneously.\n\nAs for video streaming, honestly, I don't see very much improvement over the streaming quality of just the i5, but there is no LESS quality to the streaming, and that's what matters. My monitor is a 32\" 1440p, with a 144 Hz refresh rate.\n\nI do, however, have a couple of issues with this card. On the product description page, there is clearly a picture of the various output I expected to find on this card. And if I remember right that picture had a display port, an HDMI port, a 24 pin DVI port, and a VGA port (I might be wrong about the VGA port). The card that arrived at my house, does NOT have either a VGA port or a display port. So, if your monitor has either of those, BUYER BEWARE!!! I was only ever going to use the HDMI port, so I'm not too fussed.\n\nMy bigger issue is the plastic shroud on the GPU itself. The card doesn't cover the same amount of area that the plastic shroud does, so I have several square inches of exposed plastic shroud inside my PC, acting as a \"bowl\" to catch any dust flying around. And while the Dell has a paper filter the covers the main air intake, and a sort of cone directing the CPU exhaust directly out into the room and that has kept the amount of dust inside my case to a minimum. But now there is the GPU fan sourcing air from an unfiltered area, and just exhausting the air inside the case. So, ALL bets are off as to how this plays out in the remaining life left in my aging Dell.\n\nThat is just BAD design all the way around. It uses more material than is strictly needed meaning the manufacturer is paying more than is strictly necessary for each card manufactured, and it CAN'T be good for the PC to have an actual dust catcher inside a machine that you work hard to keep dust free. And I can PROMISE the manufacturer, that if my aging Dell suddenly dies six weeks from now, I know EXACTLY who I will blame.

This is a fairly old video card ( even though new) and the original drivers that were installed have been well and truly superseded. Updated the drivers, BUT before I could take advantage of all of the cards capabilities I Had to create a Nvidia account. That really SUCKS! The card works just fine as is, and since I'm not going to use it for any heavy duty gaming I guess I'll just have to live with it as is...

Product arrived on time with typical packaging in bubble wrap bag with no damage or other issues. Got this during the Black Friday sales; good price. Bought this GPU for a DELL XPS 8900 i7-6700K Skylake CPU (yes, for 8900 NOT 8920 or 8930 or any other 89xx) and I have to say It was a bit risky thinking the GPU wouldn't take, but it did. It fits perfect and doesn't overlap on the 2240 M.2 SATA SSD (See photos). After installation NVIDIA program recognized the GPU and updated the software automatically. I'm not using this for games but I am using DreamWeaver, Photoshop, Illustrator etc... as well as ZOOM for online college courses and a couple of other graphics demanding programs. I didn't have to mess with or update the BIOS, it was simply plug and play. Temperature wise it stays pretty cool. The only modification was having to exchange the original GPU bracket with this 1030 bracket. It worked out fine.
