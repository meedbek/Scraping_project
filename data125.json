While this card is a tad expensive it is not priced at the ridiculously insane prices of the middle to high end gaming video cards in 2022. This GPU has done the job of letting me go anywhere on the internet without video lag.\n\nI had a more expensive NVIDIA GPU in my system with otherwise state of the art hardware. The newest most power Ryzen 9 \\ 5900 CPU, fast memory and a 750 watt power supply. The NVIDIA GPU ran like hot garbage on my Ubuntu system. Ubuntu has a nasty sepia color scheme that saturates the entire OS and everything in it. It is not only ugly but painful to look at due to my vision issues.\n\nI did not know for sure at the time but, I hoped a new video card from someone other than NVIDIA might perform better. Turns out this AMD designed GPU got rid of the nasty sepia tint. This video card creates a simple un-tinted OS that is a pleasure to use. The card is not BIG and uses only the power supplied by the GPU slot.\n\nThe card has some energy saver garbage installed that turns the card off if you power down your monitor. I took a star off for the energy saver mess. There really are no other issues. This is a great card to use on a Linux\\Ubuntu system that is not used for hard core gaming."

Installing this card resolved the performance issues. I was pleased enough with that purchase that I bought one for my home computer to resolve some lag issues when playing 4K video on my old PC. This card resolved that issue, too. I don't know how this product benchmarks against the completion. I didn't do any testing like that. I simply had performance issues with applications that needed a graphics card performance boost. The price was right on this graphics card and I found that it worked fine to resolve those issues.\n\nThe only issue that I had was that the package came with no English instructions, no drivers and no software. I am an IT technician by trade, so I had little trouble finding the right drivers and software online. On one PC, Windows Update found the drivers, but I still had to download and install the correct version of the Radeon software. On the other PC I had to download both the drivers and software. So, this wasn't much of a problem for me, but it may be more than a novice PC users can deal with.\n\nThis product did what I needed and I've had no problems with it either at home or at work. It gets a 5 star rating from me even though I would have expected better instructions for installing the product and obtaining the correct drivers & software."

F\u00fcr Titel wie Diablo III und Co ifinde ich die RX 550 v\u00f6llig in Ordnung und sie macht dort auch eine echt gute Figur.\n\nFazit: Es gibt nat\u00fcrlich deutlich st\u00e4rkere Grafikkarten, egal ob AMD oder NVIDIA aber wer bei dem aktuellen Auf und Ab der Grafikkartenpreise eine g\u00fcnstige und verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig starke Grafikkarte sucht, weil er sich gerade keine gro\u00dfe leisten kann oder wie bei mir f\u00fcr einen kleineren Zweitrechner, sollte hier gut bedient sein."

Overall it's slim will definitely fit in a modular case and does the trick of you are looking to do anything that's graphic hungry. Minus of course Fortnite at 60fps consistent. The value is peek. The extra 2gb of room helps to. Hope this is your final review to read before pulling the trigger. I did , great product in an oversaturated market currently"

There are other reviews that prove it but essentially a full x4 link will give you slightly better frames but the CPU itself is more dependent.\nIn other words, if you're torn between a laptop with a much better cpu and a x2 TB3 link vs a much slower one and a x4 TB3 link, get the faster CPU, the link doesn't matter quite as much except for one critical thing with VR (and I don't think x4 would help it a great deal.)\n\nThis box has extra USBs including a charging port (a keyboard/mouse doesn't effect frames) and this is critical because you'll likely need them.\n\nVR:\nThe GPU will work great with VR but you'll want to connect a monitor via DVI, the Occulus via HDMI, and disable the laptop screen. Otherwise the eGPU will think you want to re-direct video back to the laptop and cripple your performance. In theory an x4 TB3 link would work much better but it will hamper your performance anyway so don't bother.\nIn short: If you needed an eGPU for VR, you're going to want a 2nd monitor to the EGPU and disable your onboard screen.\n\nThe box is quiet, installs in a snap and doesn't need special software. The \"Aorus Engine\" app is meh, I don't use it and if the LEDs can be controlled I have no idea how. Those could theoretically be distracting but they're hidden in my setup behind my monitor anyway. You'll never hear it with headphones on, and even without, your laptop is probably louder.\n\nAs far as performance goes, with the i7-7700HQ and TB3 link I was getting 4k@60+ (\"Mein Leiben\" settings) in Wolfenstein TNC. Not the newest game but it should give you a clue as to what to expect.\n\nBased on all the research and reviews I did, I came to these conclusions:\n1) CPU matters more than Link, ideally get something with a nice boost clock and 35-45Watt range, ideally NOT a 15 \"U\" processor (although this would work game well with it, miles better than integrated, you're tossing decent performance) at least not for VR.\n2) Trying to use an eGPU on your internal monitor is probably not worth it, definitely not if you're only a x2 link on your TB3 port.\n3) With a faster i7/i5 45W mobile CPU, you can expect about 20% performance drop from a DESKTOP version of the same graphics setup (native pcie x16 link) with TB3 x4 link (40GBp/s) and about a 25% performance drop with a TB3 x2 link (20GBp/s). Measurably slower, but hard to notice and works great, with my brandy new Occulus.\n\nIf money is no object, get the 1080, it will do a little better and is probably worth it, I went with this version as I got it from a Warehouse Deal under $500."

I average around 180-200 FPS when playing League of Legends at highest settings (not a super graphically demanding game, just stating as a reference). Something I consider a positive is that it only takes a single 8 pin power connector (some people may consider it a negative, but I list as positive because it makes it easier to SLI due to taking less PSU connectors). The lighting is a nice touch to add to my already well lit rig (I have multiple Blue LED fans). Fans are not noisy (at least I do not notice them over the game sound) and the Fan Stop feature on all the 10 series is a neat idea for lowering noise and saving fan life. The Geforce XTREME Gaming app is actually pretty good. Still not quite as good as MSI Afterburner, but still a nice, easy to use interface. There are of course the default \"Eco, Normal, Gaming\" settings and then also the custom settings for overclocking. I have not tried over clocking as I have not had a need, but the software seems intuitive and easy enough to use. All in all a really great card for the price. Easily powers through games and is relatively future proof with SLI. I plan to buy another in a year or two when game specs make the next jump. Only regret is the price dropped $20 the week after I bought it, but such is life. As reference I will list my current rig below:\nCPU: AMD FX-8370E 8-Core (3.3 GHz, 4.3 OC)\nGPU: Geforce GTX 1070 G1 Gaming (duh)\nHDD: Seagate FireCuda SSHD 1TB\nMOBO: Gigabyte Ultra Durable AM3+ (could not find which model I have, It's 5 years old at this point)\nRAM: 4x4GB sticks of Mushkin Silverline DDR3 1333 (16GB total)\nCOOLING: 9 fans: 4 Antec fans (3 140mm, 1 120mm), 2 Corsair SP 120mm, 3 Thermaltake 140mm\nPSU: Thermaltake Toughpower Grand 850W\nCASE: Thermaltake Core X71\n\nIMPORTANT: As a note the GTX 10 Series cards are designed to run hot, as such there are a couple of things to keep in mind:\n1. Make sure if your rig already runs hot to keep an eye on temps when upgrading to this\n2. Despite these cards being designed to take the heat I would caution watching GPU temp during gaming at least at first\n3. I would advise going into the XTREME Gaming app and editing the fan curves, the default settings appear to allow the card to get absurdly hot, so I changed my curves to turn the fans on at a lower temperature and to ramp up to 100% fan speed faster"

The box had a large rip, the cables where everywhere and with ripped plastic bags stuffed in the cardboard box.I assume the last owner was very impatient and just started tearing into the box in a bid to get everything out as fast as possible.\n\nI didn't return it though since the actual eGPU looked to be in relatively new condition. The previous owner probably only used it for a little bit. I assumed this because when I turned it one it made this horrible whining noise that I assume came from one of the fans (only moving parts). Taking this into consideration I presume that the previous owner returned it cause of the noise. Maybe he thought it was broken or something. I open it up and saw that one of the tiny fans was making a god awful amount of noise. Luckily for me I bought two Noctua fans to replace the tiny fans that came with this GPU.\n\nI did research on this product and learned that the tiny fans that come with it were pretty noisy (really low quality fans). Therefore I bought some Noctua fan replacements. These fans are easy to replace since the fan kits come with some splice connectors. Just cut the wires that connects to the old fans and splice it using the included splice connector with the new noctua fans. I also bought a 6.6ft active TB3 cable so that I can put my GPU out of the way.\n\nMy laptop didn't have thunderbolt enabled but it did support it. Had to do a bios update then install the TB3 drivers. After that I connected the eGPU and everything worked. The computer would say that it doesn't support eGPU and/or not all functions supported but it's completely wrong. Everything in the gaming box worked perfectly. Just ignore the warning messages. This eGPU is WAY BETTER than my internal gtx 970m.\n\nWHO SHOULD GET THIS?\nget it < GTX 1060 (Any computer than has less than a GTX 1060 in performance)\n\nI've done testing and its only slightly faster than a desktop OC edition GTX 1060.\n\nP.S. - Buy the below items to improve your experience.

Where my laptop fan was constantly running at max, now it doesn't and I can also play a couple games on a laptop that was not designed for that purpose. It could even charge my laptop in tandem with everything else it does at the same time. The ports on the back provide ample room for some devices; however, few of them actually work. This is where my main issues are: The usb's on the back of the device don't support an external hard drive (as the drive does not show up when I plug it into the box), and plugging a mouse into it provides consistent stops in the mouse pointer every few seconds - so that is a no-go. What else is there to populate four usb spots on here? I don't charge my phone from it since I have a dedicated wall plug, and plugging a headset in means that the audio will constantly be making various noises while cutting in and out. Apart from that, the fans in the box (not the gpu fan) are quite loud at random times, considering the short 1 ft. cable included with the device, means either you buy a longer thunderbolt or just put up with the sound. I opted for the latter as having the egpu on my desk for easy access is necessary. The fans are also not replaceable as they have what seems to be a proprietary connection to the board in the box. Also, I recommend immediately setting a more aggressive fan curve unless you want to cook some food with the heat this thing puts out."

It stays cool all the time! I heard issues with the 1080 where they would catch on fire but never the 1070, plus the 1070 at the moment is significantly more affordable and there's no need for that extra horse power which is pretty negligible.\n\nI've used this with my Oculus, Skyrim (Legendary fully modden and SE), GW2 at max everything including word boss raids, and just about every other game I could throw at it and it has no problem running the maximum framerate of my display (60monitor 75oculus). You want to run 4K? Sure, this beast of a card will run any game for you at 4k. I was running Black Desert Online at its highest possible setting on one monitor and GW2 on another with literally no frame drop! Kindly note that I am using a shader mod for GW2 which demands much more out of it.\n\nFor my build I paired the 1070GTX with a intel i7 6700k (unlocked), water cooled, corsair vengence LPX 16GB DDR4 @ 3200mhz, and a samsung SSD drive. The mobo itself is a GA-Z170X-Gaming 7 and it is beautiful. The 1070 is serious business and I would strongly recommend it to anyone wanting to game and not have their video card catch on fire. I do feel however that games released in 2-years will be pushing this card beyond its capabilities and perhaps VR titles will become more intensive once it becomes more mainstream.\n\nI don't remember what the base clock on this is, but I know it can go over 1800mhz in OC mode which is a big jump from my previous card which clocked at 600mhz. Some people will wait until the next gen cards to come out so they can get their hands on the 1080 for cheaper but that's the name of the game, how long are you willing to wait before playing games nicely? Remember that games take about 3-5 years to develop and cross-platform games are often developed for a console which puts us back in visuals by quite some time. I'm pretty confident we will be able to breeze by 2018 with this card."

But the GTX 1070 Mini and my 6700k are making a great argument for PC gaming.\n\nMy Gigabyte GTX 1070 Mini is rocking out with an Asus Maximus VIII Impact, Intel 6700K @ 4.6 GHz, and 32GB(2x16GB) G.SKILL TridentX 3000MHz @ 3200 MHz, with a 600W Silverstone SFX power supply.

I can't count how many Gigabyte products I've owned, but I can count the number that I've sent in for RMA (all my fault by the way) on one hand. And for the few RMAs I've done, unlike many other hardware manufacturers, they've never asked for proof of purchase. It's like me: \"hey this video card is dead\" and they're all like \"okay ship it here and we'll send you a replacement\" and then a replacement arrives and I'm super happy. A few of Gigabyte's competitors are as good with warranty service, but more are effing terrible to deal with.

I'm talking constant 85fps@1440p with ALL graphics cranked up to the maximum and some sort of anti-aliasing.\nThe thing is, this card packs SUCH a strong punch that in most games (again GTA 5, ROTR, Doom, Splinter Cell Blacklist) when you deactivate some of the unnecessary settings (ultra-high quality grass? ultra-anti-aliasing on Lara's hair? sure, like that's going to make a difference when you recommend the game to a friend) then the fans barely spin, if at all. No seriously, I haven't heard the fans on this card since August.\nBesides that Gigabyte have their own Xtreme Gaming software to configure the card's overclock, fan and RGB profiles and while the first versions left room for improvement, the newer ones seem to have fixed those issues and appear to be rock-solid stable, kudos to Gigabyte about this!\nStrongly recommend this card to any gaming enthusiast out there"

There's a small ribbon attached to the fan and after a period of time it's common for this ribbon to pop up and start grazing the fan ever so slightly. While this isn't a huge detriment to performance (as far as I'm aware) it's an annoyance on a card that prides itself on being so quiet.\n\nIt is a very quiet card apart from this one design oversight that should have been addressed by now, especially since Gigabyte are aware of it. The noise especially sticks out when the fans activate, and since they're designed to turn on and off at certain temperatures, it can be something you'll hear quite frequently, especially if it's dancing around that threshold.\n\nIt's such a shame because it really is an incredible card and Gigabyte usually make some amazing hardware, but I can't get past this one flaw. Maybe other people can, but I like my system to remain as quiet as possible, and hearing these light grunts from the card so frequently is hard to ignore for me."

Another reviewer complained of coil whine/noise. I haven't experienced any noise problems with this card as of this review. My case is tight so a 9 inch plus card was out of the question. My previous card was a GeForce 660 so this thing tramples it in performance and I particularly like the H.264/H.265 video encoding feature for screen capture/live streaming.\n\nThe card is approximately 6.7\" in length and requires just one 8 pin power supply cable. Luckily my power supply has a 6+2 pin so no adapter was required. A cable is NOT included with the card. They also don't include an NVidia sticker either. The only big negative I can think of is that the card is tall and covers up my other PCIe slot. But hey, that's my fault for buying a computer with a small case, right? I can live with it.\n\nUs computer geeks love statistics, right? My 3DMark Sky Diver 1.0 score was 29,605 which puts it in the 90th percentile of all tested cards. The Fire Strike 1.1 benchmark was 13,302 with a 83rd percentile mark. Considering my previous card was over five years old, I am very happy with these numbers! Ironically, most of the games I play aren't very demanding but I can tell you this. I played the For Honor beta and everything ran great. One day, I will take full advantage of this thing with a VR headset but not any time soon.\n\nA tip for newbies: You do NOT need a Mini ITX computer to install this card. It's a standard PCIe connector. Also, upgrade your RAM! Add another 8 GB to make up for the resources that this card will take up. Otherwise, you may find your system slowing down. 16 GB of RAM total is my recommendation."

I have to drop it to four stars because, while I'm so happy I can play games I couldn't before, it it only marginally better that the apparently obsolete Nvidia 430 I replaced with this purchase. While probably considered midrange, if you or the one you're buying this for is playing video games this is the minimum at the time of this writing. For you who are on a budget like me this is the best you can do. This is the best value for the money *at this time.* When you start spending more money than this you have to start worrying about reliability and the physical size of the graphics card.

Color me surprised. The card is a nice little productivity card for the price.

                    "text": "For hard core gamers, we all know that the single fan ducted stock-cooler reference design is loud and does a very poor job at cooling. So I fully expected this to sound like a hair dryer when frame rates were cranked up but not as loud as it actually performed. I probably shouldn't compare it to my own hair dryer because that would be unfair to my hair dryer, this video card was much louder. LOL\n\nNevertheless, I went into this purchase knowing the cooling may have to be augmented but wanted to see for myself. My plan B was to add an aftermarket Arctic cooler if this board did not perform.\n\nThis board started to thermal-throttling at rest before any apps were launched. Oh boy did this cooling solution fail to live up to expectation. As soon as I plugged it in, the board immediately started to overheat and the NVIDIA chip throttled back once it hit 85 \u00b0C. Remember, water boils at 100 \u00b0C. Now of course, that's what it is designed to do in order to protect the GPU, but you pay for it by only getting half the performance which is probably why the seller sold this card in the first place. His loss, my gain after I added a non-stock cooler.\n\nMy benchmarks showed a 30% decrease right out of the gate after thermal throttling kicked in. Now note, my case is thermally neutral in that I operate it open air with plenty of fans and my temperature sensor confirmed that the internal temperature of the case was equal to room temp. So this rise in temp was solely due to the lousy stock cooler on the board.\n\nHowever, after I added an Arctic IV cooler to this, the board performed fantastically. In fact, unless I unplugged the fan, I couldn't get the NVIDIA GPU to go beyond 65 \u00b0C. I was getting full performance with the fans only set to 25% and very quiet, even without overclocking, I was getting top-end benchmark scores. There are other aftermarket coolers but the Arctic IV has two heat sinks and three fans. Note: This is not a solution for everyone because it triples the width of the card so if your case is tight, this may not work for you. Check the specs for your case and motherboard to see if it will fit.\n\nAll in all, the refurb deal in this case was a fantastic win for me even after adding a not-so-cheap aftermarket fan. But even with that additional cost, I got top performance at 50% of the cost of a new 3 fan GPU from the same company or one of its competitors. For those of you who understand GPU binning, the board I got clearly got the lower end of the GPU lottery in that I was not able to dramatically overclock this like some other boards. On using Unigine Superposition benchmark using default 1080P settings, the board performed around 14K with the stock cooler and jumped to 16K score with the after market cooler. I was able to coax it up to 17K but not very stable so I keep it at around 16.2K on the Unigine Superposition benchmark.\n\nI'll chalk this up as a big win and I am totally happy with the purchase. Note: Adding an aftermarket cooler does void any warranties so that's a risk you have to be willing to take. But the good news is that this board had no warranty seals so if it did fail I could have put the old cooler back on and sent it back for warranty repair. Thumbs up for those guys for not putting those silly stickers on."

The performance is just stellar at 1080p high refresh, (This is really a 1440p card Though). Forza 4 Ultra ? Not a problem 125-144 FPS.\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider Ultra with RTX on and DLSS off and with the rest turned on to max 50~60 FPS average minimum can dip into the ~35 FPS and Its Very beautiful to look at. With RTX off still a pretty game but much faster with an average of ~85 FPS.\n\nNot surprisingly Watch Dogs 2 being poorly optimized still dropping below 22 FPS when you in the streets if settings are maxed out. In some older games (2016 and earlier ), even 4K is possible. At 1080p, I am happy and can't complain with the performance on my system.\n\nNoise and Temperature\nAs advertised , the card is silent below 51C but at full load , the cards fans are slightly audible which i found disappointing as compared to the 780 GTX that was silent at all times . The card temperature does not go past 71C.\n\nLooks and LED Lights\nFrom the photos of the card , i thought the LEDS would match the brightness of corsair H100i in my case. As soon as i switched on the machine i regretted my purchase. if only i had bought the Strix card instead I said. The old 780 GTX it replaced looked great in the build power LEDs were a soft green that did not overpower build theme.\n\nThe card looks very nice but the LEDs overpowering and so blinding that you cannot see the beauty of the card. In a dark room the LEDs shine like torches through the grates in the case forming a pattern on the celling and walls that make it difficult to sleep with the PC on.\n\nSuper Natural Bundle\nI bought the game expecting to get Control and Wolfenstein Young Blood bundle as Nvidia and Asus Said the competition was open to all those who bought 20 Series RTX card. Only to be told that my country was not part of the promotion and i could not redeem the code even if they gave me one. I was so disappointed . If it was not going to be expensive to return and buy the superior and less costly AMD 5700 XT instead, I would have done it. But because of the high custom duty was off putting.\n\nI guess Africa is not an important enough region for Asus or Nvidia to promote their graphic cards since it seems like the only continent left out in the promotion.\n\nConclusion\nPros\nIts a big beautiful card to look at and LED strip adds to the beauty.\nGreat performance at 1440p and 1080p\nDVI port\nCons\nI wish the lights were not so bright or could be turned off.\nFans get slightly audible during high load.\nPrice is a bit steep for performance when compared to the similarly priced yet superior AMD 5700 XT.\nRTX titles are very few and RTX performance cost is still high."

I game occasionally at 2K, on a brilliant 32\" VA panel, so the GTX 1070 or 1070 ti was a perfect candidate.\nAmazon ran a simply killer deal on this card, and it was too good to pass up. As to my research, I could not find a bad review on the ASUS Strix GTX 1070 ti Advanced. So, I pulled the trigger and I am glad I did.\nAs for this particular GTX 1070 ti Video Card, it seems that ASUS went their own way on Overclocking, and my particular card would OC out of the box to 1911 Mhz with no adjustments. This is in contrast to the majority of GTX 1070 ti Cards that were \"locked down\" from the factory. The AIB partners could not ship overclocked GPUs, but there was no problem for the end users to OC. Oh, and it would run that at 50 Degrees C. I do not believe that I have ever come across a cooler running video card. I decided to run up the OC on MSI Afterburner, and came up with 2011 Ghz fairly easily, and I am not finished yet. The ASUS GTX 1070 ti Advanced uses specially binned GPUs, and I am pretty sure that I am running video close to a stock GTX 1080.\nRunning Unigine Heaven 4.0 on High at 2K with 2011 Mhz OC gave me a score of 2153, all at 53 Degrees C. I am not sure that most water cooling is that good.\nYes, the card is massive and heavy. I do notice a little bit of sag. The RGB LEDs do look nice if you like that. and the Aura software works well. I have not tried the ASUS OC software yet, as I still like Afterburner, but I can say that this is a really well thought out and engineered video card, and I am quite happy with it. I have not gamed a lot with it yet, but what I have tried, did exceed my old GTX 1070 by 10% to 15% in FPS at 2K.\nDespite the new RTX 2070-2080 Cards being launched, I am going to be pretty happy with this for a while. Very happy I made this purchase, and I am thankful to Amazon, and to ASUS."

It's a very heavy card, weighing a couple pounds, and taking up the same amount of room as a GTX 1080 Ti. RTX 2060 can take just about anything you throw at it at 60FPS in 1440p. I haven't had an opportunity to try it with raytracing yet, but it will earn you a 8000ish score in TimeSpy. This particular model is the most tricked out version of the RTX 2060 you can find. The backplate makes the card extremely durable. RGB, 3 fans, backplate, and the highest overclock you can get from a manufacturer, unless you go with a SUPER series card, you won't get better than this. It will require an 8 pin connector and a 6 pin connector to power the card. The cooler is one of the best you will ever find for any card. Besides having 3 dust-resistant fans, upon teardown, you will find several different methods of keeping the card cool, and I have yet to see this card go past 62 degrees while playing anything, even with DX12 settings turned on.\n\nGaming wise, not sure exactly how this compares to other types of cards, but supposedly it can be overclocked to nearly match the 2070. When NVIDIA's GeForce Experience recommends \"OPTIMAL\" settings, this card exceeds its expectations, and you can usually get a bit more out of the settings than it estimates you can because of it's higher overclock and superior cooling.\n\nWhile the SUPER series just came out, this card is perfect for the enthusiast who doesn't game frequently, but wants a system that can handle anything he or she wants to play. Also, supposedly the encoder rivals quicksync, which makes it better for use with video."

Prior to making this purchase I had to justify the price point ($399) since other manufacturers were selling the 2060 at a lower cost. After doing extensive research, I ended up purchasing this one because it had better overall benchmarks than MSI, Gigabyte, and even NVIDIA's Founders Edition. Destiny 2 and The Witcher III can be played on max settings in 1080p without any lag. I have yet to try the 1440p settings because my monitor doesn't support it. The triple fan setup hasn't turned on once and the Aura Sync RGB is nice eye candy.\n\nThe only reason I gave this 4 stars was because Amazon's tracking of redemption codes was subpar. At the time of purchase, this GPU came with a free game redemption (Battlefield V or Anthem). While I did receive a code from Amazon, it turns out that it was one that had already been redeemed. The customer service reps were quick in responding and I received two other codes, but they were also invalid for the same reason. I was finally given a 4th code that worked so I was thankful for that.\n\nAll in all, the card itself was worth the cost at $399 because you get a superb card out of the box. There is also room for overclocking, but the current settings are sufficient for my needs now. I would have given this 5 stars had Amazon been better with their handling of redemption codes."

I will say this, if you are looking for components to stay with a certain theme, I would like to think a builder would do some more research, such as check the brand's website and look at reviews before making purchases.\n\nAll in all, this is a great card, especially if you're still gaming on 1080p, such as myself. I can even see this card doing well with 1440p, just not 4K, but let's be honest, the only thing that'll run games at that resolution is a 2080 and up. Price to performance, this card is great."

It is in every way superior to the card priced $50 lower, provided space is not at a premium in your system and there is adequate interior airflow. It's quite tall, extending nearly 1 inch above the screws that hold it down against the back of the case, and very wide at roughly 2.25 slots.\n\nWhat you get in return for spending the extra money is a card that is far quieter and cooler than the squirrel cage fan model that vents out the rear. The ROG Strix has a metal plate that acts as a giant heat sink, which allows for easier heat dissipation. It also features 3 large , slow fans that largely stay off, even under load, because the backplate does its job so well. Mine barely tick over while gaming, which is great because noise drives me insane. The squirrel cage on the $449 version is very loud by comparison, and spools up very quickly under load to dump heat generated by the card under load. This card is roughly 21c cooler as well, which should mean greater longevity and more room to overclock, if you desire. I was able to get +150 GPU / +400 MEM without any trouble during benchmark applications, including Unigine on loop for 8 hours. All of the games in my current rotation play fine without overlocking, so its back to stock, but its great to know there is additional headroom in the future.\n\nIn short, I'd strongly recommend this card if the 1070ti is what you're looking to purchase. Slippery slope but the 1080 may be a better value for an additional $25-50, however it does generate more heat, and that extra few bucks is a game (or two or three during Steam sales) so decide where you'd like to spend the money."

                    "text": "Ended up getting really lucky and buying this from Amazon Warehouse in \"like new\". While the box was damaged a bit and the CD looked pretty beat up, the card itself did look pristine. I couldn't tell if it was used or \"abused\". Been benchmarking the card for the last week to make sure and the card exceeded expectations with some things that people should know:\n1) The ASUS GPU Tweak II software must be loaded in order for any custom OC settings to kick in. If this doesn't happen, sometimes the your OC setting will stick and sometimes they won't. There is an issue with the latest version of this software and Windows 10 build 1067 where it will not auto load on Windows start even if you check the options. So for now, I have to start the application every time I boot. It's annoying.\n2) In GPU Tweak II there are presets. I'll only talk about \"Gaming Mode\" and \"OC Mode\". Gaming mode is the default and supposedly running stock clocks. However, I found this to not be true via various monitoring software - GPU-Z, Afterburner, and even ASUS's monitor software. In Gaming Mode, you're actually running OC clocks. I think it's a bug in their software. So in this mode, I can achieve not just the advertised 1936 MHz clocks but up to 2000 MHz. So this is great! What does \"OC Mode\" do then? Well this actually takes your OC even higher and attempts 2088 to 2100 MHz. The card is fairly stable there BUT, for me, I'm not able to pass 3D Mark Firestrike at all unless I drop it down to 2038 MHz or so. One thing to note here is that when Firestrike fails, the test stops gracefully - no hangs or artifacting. I can pass Heaven though @ 2100MHz. So it's likely ok to run in OC Mode but realize it's really pushing the gpu clocks. This may explain why people complain the GPU is not stable because they \"think\" in order to get to the advertised 1936MHz you have to run OC Mode and what happens is that they're pushing 2100MHz, which I feel is the borderline. So despite my benchmarking, I never encountered artifacting. Had I seen any, I probably would have presumed card was abused and returned it.\n3) I've adjusted the fan profile and can maintain ~70 C at highest OC. If you don't do this the default fan profile is biased towards being quiet which means fans don't kick in until you hit higher temps. Some people have stated that the fans don't work when they don't realize that they actually don't kick in until 40C or so. It may be higher with default fan profile. I never bothered trying to figure this out and set my own profile. So the fans are likely working but they will not spin like you may be used to until the card gets to a certain temp.\n4) Memory OC, I've read can go as high as 11000MHz. I have mine set at 10500MHz with no problems. I'm pretty confident I can hit 11000MHz but I wanted some buffer to ensure stability. The last few 100MHz for either GPU or Memory clock isn't going to make much of a difference in gaming or benchmarks. Just with the OC I have, I'm only getting a few hundred points increases in Firestrike. 1080 GTX stock is already a beast!\n\nOverall, if you get this card, you will get more than the advertised 1936 MHz boost and the ASUS software is already setup to attempt fairly aggressive OC. So if you're not the kind to tweak your OC you can easily get a nice stable OC out of the box. The card is very quiet vs. my old Sapphire 7970 Radeon and runs much cooler in terms of temps.\n\nThis card has one, if not the fastest, OC clocks advertised out of the box which is why it's hard to get. Check the \"other seller\" section often and if you see one in \"like new\" condition from Amazon Warehouse, GET IT at a nice discount!!! It will be gone before you know it. And absolutely DO NOT pay more than the $679.99 MSRP. Anyone else trying to sell you higher is taking advantage of you and ripping you off.\n\n**************************************\nUpdate: 11/10/16\n\nPeople buying ASUS on Amazon be aware that you WILL NOT get Gears of War 4 promotion even though it qualifies. I tried to work with ASUS customer support but they've taken a \"not our problem attitude\". The rub? For all the Asian countries ASUS gives promo codes direct and there's a process. For any country outside their special list, you're pretty much SOL. I had multiple exchanges with ASUS support and they keep telling me to go to Geforce.com to get my code. And when you go there it redirects you back to ASUS. I tried to explain this to ASUS customer support and they keep saying the same thing - go to geforce.com to get your code. It's like talking to a robot. If they have a process to provide GoW4 codes for other countries why can't they do it for the rest of the customers? Customers buying their product should be treated equally. Perhaps this can be a class action lawsuit. Card may be good but customer support SUCKS!! It's making me think twice and will check out other vendors like EVGA. I've heard they honor their promo codes with no hassle and treat customers they they should be treated. Disappointing! >:("

                    "text": "I am not the biggest gamer that ever lived, but I recently bought the HTC Vive virtual reality system, and I wanted a video card that could handle that, and whatever other games I wanted, so I wouldn't have to update to a new card in a year or less. I looked at other cards, and this card was better than 2 of the next best cards, but priced at less than 2x the price. So, the choice was obvious: Buy two competing cards, spending more money, getting less performance, or buying this card.\n\nI run all my games on a 4K UHD monitor, and I use the highest settings. I have never seen a visible lag, or pixilation, it is just flawless. As for the virtual reality, it is amazing, with this card there is no comprehensible lag between motion and update on the display. It is so incredibly immersive. I have to assume this card has a lot to do with just how great this experience is. If you are considering getting the Titan, or this, get THIS. If you ever need a little boost then you buy a second 1080, and put it in SLI mode. The two 1080's are still cheaper than the Titan, and I guarantee you that this is the only card you will need for a while. With DDR4 memory, 4Ghz CPU, M.2 HDD, and this card there is nothing this machine cannot do. You can enable every setting, to the max, 4K resolution, and this card just happily takes it. The STRIX supports overclocking via their app, so you can squeeze out a little more if you need it, but I seriously doubt you will need if for quite a while.\n\nI have played with the app, it lets you overclock as you want, and it lets you set the fan thresholds, and colors, etc. I tried overclocking a bit, and it worked just fine, but I haven't found a game that it couldn't handle without overclocking, so I don't bother to actually use it. You can create different profiles, so you can easily turn on or off the overclocking. I set the fan to be quiet, but I don't set it at the 0db setting. I prefer a little fan noise and keeping my card nice and cool. However, in the case that I have I cannot hear the fan, so it really doesn't matter.\n\nI set the colors to match the motherboard, case, keyboard and mouse. Now my computer looks like a work of art. It is something I display proudly as it is just so friggin cool.\n\nThe specs speak for themselves. 8GB of VRAM is impressive, especially that it is GDDR5, running at 1,825Mhz at 256-bits in width. That is a sick memory throughput. The new Titan is the only card that I know of that can beat this one in compute power, but it is not as good for gaming as this. The number of CUDA cores is staggering, something like 2560+. This video card is a true supercomputer in and of itself. But, it plays games like they're nothing. It just works, on the highest setting, at 4K resolution, or in Vive VR, and it doesn't even get hot. It usually runs like 40-50C at the most when playing the most taxing games. Keeping it nice and cool will ensure a long life span.\n\nI don't know what else I can say. If you want to play the newest and best games, this is the card for you. Whether you are a true overclocker, or just want to drop in the card and forget it, this is the card for you. If you have a fancy machine, with LED lighting, and an open side panel, this is the card for you. I had originally bought the reference model of the 1080, but I changed to the ROG version for the better fans, and more sturdy heat sink.\n\nAnother great feature is the number of video ports this has. It has 2 UHD HDMI ports, two full sized display port ports and a DVI port. I use one of the DP with my HTC Vive, and one of the HDMI with my Samsung 28\" 4K UHD monitor.\n\nPros: Incredible performance, as good or better than 2 of the next best cards. Supports SLI for 2 or three cards. Has 8GB of GDDR5 memory, and over 300 CUDA core. Plays the newest games in 4K UHD with >60fps and never lags or stutters. 2 HDMI and one DP for multiple monitors, or VR. Works perfect with HTC Vive.\n\nCons: It is a bit pricey. But, when you figure you would need to of the next best card to compete, it is really not that bad."

It goes without saying that I was waiting for this card for awhile. I was tempted to buy the 980ti many times. It didn't help her brother and one of my best friends both bought the 980ti. Now that I have the 1080, I'm glad I waited. I upgraded from a 780 with 3g of video memory. Going from 3g to 8g made a huge difference as I use a 2560x1440 27in monitor. It wasn't a needed upgrade by any means. I played most games on highest settings prior, but with some frame drops. Now, if my frame drops in a game, it's due to poor coding. At least, I tell myself that. Hasn't happened much, but if it does, it's in a populated server/city/channel on an MMO.\nI purchased the graphics card on 7/8/16 and it came in on 7/13/16. It wasn't in stock on the 8th, but said it would be on the 10th. I wasn't sure if I should trust it, but since it was at MSRP and said to be fulfilled by Amazon, I figured if I received it within a month, it would beat paying someone $800+. Whenever these cards became available to purchase, they were already sold. This made it a pain in the rear to even buy it. I turned on 1 click purchasing and went to [...] to set up browser notifications to alert me when it was available. After clicking purchase about 100 or so times, the transaction went through and I became an owner of this card.\nThe packaging from Asus was solid. The packaging from Amazon was a bit weak, but with the hard foam and static resistance cover of the graphics card, they probably didn't even need to box it. I'll never use the coupon/game code they gave me. Battleships just isn't my genre.\nTo install the card, it required getting to my mobo, removing the 780, placing the 1080 into the same slot, and plugging in the same cords into the 1080. When you apply power to the graphics card, there are two LED lights, one by each of the power plugs, that indicate if they are plugged accurately. If they are white, you're good. If they are red, you're not good. When I booted my computer the first time it loaded my OS and took me to my desktop. The resolution wasn't 2560x1440, but after it finished updating the BiOS (I'm assuming, that and UPnP stuff) it required a restart.\nOn the restart it loaded to my windows login page, but everything was black. I figured out that it had swapped to the DisplayPort vs HDMI. When I reverted to HDMI, it was on my monitors native resolution and all was well. I ran the set-up CD provided by ASUS. Not sure where the overclock management program went, but I've been to amazed at the smooth graphics on games to even try to reinstall or fiddle with it.\nBottom line, if you were like me and had a graphics card with <6gb of video memory, I would suggest getting this card. If you have a 980 or 980ti, even though this card is better, I would hold on until the 1080ti or the rumored/pre-released Titan version is released. Hope this helps someone."

Seriously?\nThen, as far as I can see, there is no other hardware manual. The online Installation manual covers software only!\n\n-Illustration under item \"7\" on page two incorrectly shows a 4-pin Molex connector being plugged into a power supply from the card. There IS no 4-pin Molex connector socket on the card. Ignore this illustration.\n\n-Product includes an 8-pin power socket, a 6-pin power socket, and an 8-pin to dual 6-pin wire adapter. Which socket do you use? One? Both? Always put the adapter in and use all three? Tech support says \"make sure to feed power to both sockets, and you don't have to use the optional splitting wire adapter unless your power supply doesn't support the 8-pin plugs.\"\n\n-This ignores the question of whether to feed both sockets off of connectors from one PS cable with two end plugs, or use two cables off the power supply. Using two cables should result in better current flow and less overheating of the cables (remember, this is pulling about as much power as three 60-watt light bulbs). But then, don't you have to worry about ground loops? So recommendation here is unclear.\n\n-No, zero, zilch, nada documentation on the two 4-pin fan headers on the right edge of the board. Do they include Aura LED control? Where do the control signals come from? With two headers, it looks instinctively like the fan should maybe be daisy-chained, so that fan input would come from one place, go through the board, and go into fan output on the other header. This is completely wrong. Both headers are FAN OUTPUT only. Both are slaved together, so that you only get one control. The concept is to put one or two of your neighboring fans onto these fan header(s), then that fan gets driven by the fan controller in the 1080 card. The advantage of this is that it turns the fan(s) off when the 1080 card's fan is turned off. And it also gives you two extra fan headers in the box. Disadvantages are that you run the power for the fans through the 1080 card, and you lose control over when you want to turn the fans on and off. There is still an outstanding question as to where does the external fan control come from in the first place? How well is this integrated with the famous Asus Aura color system? And where does the board get its commands from? Docs are silent. Best guess is both the LEDs and the Fans get their recommended settings in software, off the PCI bus, without any cable coming in at all. How well does this work under Unix? We'll see.\n\n- No documentation on air flow direction. The air comes out of the FRONT side of the three fans. Heat goes up, which is why we have huge fans on top of the case and at the top back, to keep the air moving in the upwards & outwards direction. ASUS, in their wisdom, have put the hotplate on top and the heatsink + fans on the bottom face of the card, as it is typically mounted in an upright tower system, so that the hot air is pushed down by the fans towards the floor. Not the way I would have designed it."

I recently built a custom enthusiast gaming PC with the most premium parts I have ever personally utilized. So, given that, I consider this video card the heart of my Rig. While it isn't the fastest video card on the market, it is easily one of the second fastest cards out there, and Asus sure knows how to build a premium video card. If you read the reviews on this card, you will learn that it is actually very quiet. I have yet to hear all three fans spin. At idle, the back fan will occasionally spin; however, when it does, the RPM's are so low that I barely hear it. And I said, \"occasionally\". Sometimes the fan does not spin at all. Since it is the summer, and I do not have AC, my motherboard ambient temperature creeps up a bit. When this happens, the back fan spins some. At night, when it has cooled off, the ambient temperature decreases and the fan does not spin at all. When gaming, this card still doesn't produce a lot of noise. I've witnessed two fans engage but not all three yet, and when the two fans engage, the RPM's still are relatively low. Asus did a great job with the heat pipes.\n\nThe video card comes overclocked out of the box. So far, I have had no need to overclock it any further. I am not a heavy gamer. Sure, I do game, but I do not own tons of games yet so keep this in mind when reading my review. Others on here who are really a gaming enthusiast may have better information for you. For my purposes, this video card is almost over-kill. I really mean that. This video card is a beast. I love ASUS products. When building my PC, I purchased the ROG Crosshair VII Hero (Wi-Fi) to be the \"body\" of my Rig. Due to this, the motherboard and video card operate seamlessly. The software for both the motherboard and video card compliment each other.\n\nIf you purchase this product, I don't believe you will be disappointed. If you have the money, sure, the Asus nVidia 1080ti would be nice. I had the money, and believe it or not, I opted to not spend almost a $1,000 on that video card. I just didn't see the need to spend that kind of money on a video card that I would never fully utilize. Does that make sense? Like I said in my review, for my purposes, this video card has all the oomph I will ever need, and it is still possibly more powerful for what I do on my Rig. I hope this review helps some of you make a decision!"

I will not have to upgrade my card for a very, very long time. I currently have a Ryzen 5 1600 cpu with 16GB 3200 DDR4 RAM to go with the gpu.\n\nPros:\n- (Cooling) The cooling on this thing is amazing. I have an open case with good airflow, but had issues with cooling on my previous card. Even running a full stress test, this thing never got over 78 C. It usually runs about 65C - 70C in most games on Ultra settings.\n- (Noise) Even with the amazing cooling, this thing runs very quiet compared to other cards I've used. It's slightly audible when not using headphones, but even then it's barely a distraction. My tower sits right next to me and I'm very happy with the noise level of the fans, even when they're running high speed.\n- (Drivers and RGB) The drivers are incredibly easy to download and the software to change the RGB is very easy to use. The lighting on this unit looks beautiful and you can even customize it to change and react to audio playing on your computer. I have an RGB build and this was a fantastic addition to my build.\n- (Performance) I cannot be happier with the performance of this gpu. There's a reason it's such a popular card: this thing is a BEAST. I play games like the Witcher 3 and Overwatch on Ultra settings (1440/144Hz) and have never dipped under 60FPS. In Overwatch, I average ~200 FPS and the Witcher ~80 FPS. I plan to overclock the card later, so this is with base clock.\n\nCons:\n- (Price) Currently while writing this review we are amidst the cryptocurrency mining hype, and gpus are both hard to find and incredibly expensive as a result. I luckily purchased mine before Amazon went out of stock, but I would not pay more than $600 for this card. I've seen it as high as $780 and that is honestly just a ridiculous price. If it's that high, be patient. For that price you may as well invest in a 1080ti.\n\nI have attached photos of my build so you can see the RGB of the card, and will post performance benchmarks later."

While the '80 series typically runs the hottest and uses the most electricity, the 1080 series bucks that trend, using less juice under load, being better about running idle until needed, and definitely stays much cooler than previous '80 series cards. Take note though: these cards are HUGE. My 680s had two fans, this one has three, filling my enormous case right up to the edge of my front-panel fan housing.\n\nI really like the ASUS GPUTweak II software; it makes it really easy for me to set up custom fan curves and overclocking profiles for any temperature problems, make the video cards run differently for different games, or just quickly click to go from \"Silent\" to \"Gaming\".\n\nOne card has proven to be pretty sturdy at handling any game I throw at it at full settings using 1080p--however, I'm running 2 in SLI, and when the time comes that I can step up to 4K resolution, I think it's going to handle it quite nicely. GTA V, Arkham Knight, and Fallout 4 all consume less than 8GB of VRAM at full settings and (when Arkham Knight isn't randomly reminding us how buggy it is) frame rates are rock solid.\n\nThe one thing that disappointed me was ASUS tech support. I had a pretty simple problem. Filling in every detail on their tedious form, I got a thank-you page that said I'd get a response in 24-48 hours. 8 days later, I got a generic cut & paste answer that had nothing to do with my problem. \"Clean the contacts on the card with an eraser\" for a new system and motherboard opened right out of the box. The fact that I couldn't even respond because the reply page threw errors made my support path less than useless and a huge waste of my time."

Seeing as how i was building a Gaming rig from scratch, I just couldn't see having a tower sitting there for two weeks with no gaming capability at all. This popped up and at the time it was only $100 more than the 1070 I had saved in my cart. I'm glad amazon was out of stock now.\n\nI play some pretty graphic heavy games.(Ark, Metal gear solid TPP, Rainbow 6 Siege, just to name a few) and I had been playing on an asus laptop with a 970M GPU. I could barely play ark on a modified \"high\" setting. I had to lower several of the more detailed options manually. But this GPU... I have it running on epic with only \"Sky quality\" lowered to about half(and thats mainly because it can cause too much of a visual glare like looking into the sun) Now I haven't checked an actual FPS counter, But I can tell you I have no screen tearing, no lagging, no glitches! I run at 1920x1080 Borderless window mode and This thing can handle Ark with a breeze.\n\nUsing Asus Gpu Tweak II app found on their website I was able to create a custom profile using the base stock overclock preset and ramping up fan power that runs the GPU at 102%power at around 60 to 64 degree(Celsius) while playing Ark.\n\nWhen playing Rainbow 6 Siege with a friend, I ran the in game benchmark and was getting 250+FPS(not sure how accurate it is). It was quite impressive.\n\nAnd finally i use Uniging Heaven Benchmark to put a massive stress test on this GPU. I am happy to say that on the higest possible settings, It ran between 95-120 FPS without ANY Issues at all!\n\nI may buy a second and run SLI one day but for now, This graphics Card has NO DOWNSIDES!!!. The RGB lighting isn't overkill either. I have an Asus z270F motherboard and using the asus Aura app syncs all the RGB LEDs up flawlessly and easily I just can't say enough about this GPU. I'd give it more stars if I could"

This may well be because I\u2019ve only been doing set up, etc. if problems arise, I\u2019ll edit this review. My plan is to build a new rig with either Threadripper or 8th gen Intel and this Card will eventually migrate there.\nThe card is huge, and it is easy to get it misaligned when you think you\u2019re right on. It is also easy to hit jumpers, etc and disconnect them. I\u2019ve gone through multiple cards over the years, and this is the most difficult to install in that it is easy to get it wrong. Also, it requires two additional power inputs, an 8 and a 10 pin connector. It also has two fan controllers for case fans. Four conductor lines are necessary to take advantage of this feature.\nFinally, do not trust the registration program that is installed with the drivers!! When I tried to use it, it picked up my motherboard S/N, , but let me type in the device description. It would not let me change the S/N and when ASUS came back with info that the device was already registered, I dashed on a supercritical review for Amazon, then went on the ASUS website to tell them the problem. They asked for the S/N, which I entered as the one the registration program found and my motherboard popped up! The program thought I was trying to re-register my motherboard and would not let me enter the correct serial number.\nSo here I am, back at Amazon, re-writing this review. It was only up for maybe an hour, but if anyone saw it, it is wrong. I did get a new card as ordered, Amazon did a perfect job, and I learned to check everything out before writing in anger."

I was hesitant on trying a new style of GPU but I am happy for the most part.\n\nI will start off with the shipping and packaging section of the review. The GPU came inside of a well fitted box with room to spare so it wasn't smashed lowering the chances of breaking. Inside of the Amazon box, the GPU was surrounded with the air packaging around all sides. There wasn't any dents or scratches on the box or GPU itself and am happy with how it was packaged.\n\nOpening up the actual box that held the GPU always puts a smile on the face. Everything was nicely inside and was obviously brand new. The GPU did not have any scratches or dents. The product was exactly how described in length and looks. One worry from other reviewers was the length of this GPU and if it would fit inside of their cases. I can vouch that it is very long and does need a pretty wide case to fit.\n\nThis GPU has 3 fans installed which help for the length and the power. I took off one star due to the fact of the noise it makes sometimes. I am hearing a small coil like sound coming from the GPU and as it is quite annoying it does not mess with performance. So far, I ran games such as Total war Rome 2 and Warhammer, Skyrim Special Edition, and Torchlight 2 for a smaller scale game, and the heat the GPU was putting out was very minimal.\n\nContinuing performance, I can run any game on max/ultra settings and even customize the settings further to find the max potential. I also heavily mod my games with 50 + mods in Skyrim and this runs everything perfectly. I can't complain even about a hiccup in graphics.\n\nI suggest everyone to add this GPU on their list when comparing which graphics card to choose for their next build or upgrade."

It was easy to install in my TUF B450M-Gaming Mobo and has plenty of room inside my Antec P100 case.\n\nThe packaging is great and there were no dents or damages even though I shipped it overseas.\n\nEVGA's Precision X1 software is very comfortable for overclocking. I added about 100Mhz to both my clock and memory speeds and while gaming it sits at about 80C comfortably. In the future, I'll install everything in a new case that has better airflow and I'm sure the temps will drop below that toasty 80C mark.\n\nI own a Dell gaming monitor with FreeSync (144hz) and the G-Sync/Adaptive-Sync is working great! This card + monitor combo is great.\n\nOverall, I'm happy to be running games on Ultra again. This card is great and EVGA's version has always appealed to me more than other vendors' cards in the market. Prices are a bit steep but considering the prices we saw last year with the Crypto Currency fiasco, 5XX US dollars is fine."

My biggest worry was coil whine and, where is some extremely minor coil whine at heavy loads, I'm barely able to hear it even without headphones on (and with headphones it simply doesn't exist). I do believe having a good PSU is necessary to avoid it, I'm using an RM850x.\n\nThe issue I do have is with the EVGA software. The interface has no explanation to anything, so I had to look up what all of the features are, and my profiles never want to save, so the GPU color keeps getting set back to the previous one. Still 5 stars because the card itself is terrific.\n\nWould highly recommend a gpu support bracket as this is a chunky boy and sag bad."

The support has a rubber top, and a very sticky base to prevent it from moving. Be sure to line up the top and bottom, exactly where you want it BEFORE peeling off the paper on the bottom. Put a pencil mark in the floor of the PC exactly where you want the base to stick. Raise the device to where it will be on the GPU. You will be able to move it around on the bottom at this point. Once it\u2019s lined up, put a pencil mark on the floor of the PC. Remove the device, and the paper on the bottom of the support, place the sticky pad where you marked on the floor of the PC. If you get it wrong, it is difficult to get it unstuck (trust me I know!). If you make a mistake, the sticky pad will be adhered to the bottom of your case, but you can carefully remove it with your nail and put it back on the support. I placed my support between the fans, in a small divot on the graphics card, raised the support about a half inch to make the card level. Then I raised the smaller ring up, and hand tightened it to lock it in place. It has stayed there for over a week with no issues. Good device, almost minus one star for no instructions,. Hopefully this helps."

Later on I realized it wasn't the card, or my CPU or anything else connected to my motherboard. It was the way I had everything connected to my PSU. I have a Corsair 850 watt RMA fully modular power supply. I did not realize it actually makes a difference having your eight pin GPU connectors in the peripherals modulars and having your CPU 8 pin connectors in the CPU modulars. My problem was I had it connected backwards, GPU 8 pin was in the CPU modulars, CPU 8 pin was in the peripherals modulars. Once I disconnected everything from my PSU, and corrected the order everything needed to be connected in the modulars, everything now works absolutely perfect. Don't listen to big tech YouTubers that review this card if they ever get their hands on it. If you're looking to upgrade from a 20 series, or 5000 series, this card is an absolute beast. Some people will say don't get a 6700, get the 6800, but if you're thinking about the numbers when it comes to overclocking. The difference is really 4 gigabytes of VRAM between the two, and the 6700 gigabyte elite overclocks at almost 2700 megahertz. It is definitely worth noting, this card is just over $900. And it performs just as well, or on point with the 6800 xt cards. I highly recommend getting this card for an upgrade if you don't want to spend $1300 to $1,500 on a 6800 Xt card.\n\nUpdate, these 6000 series cards need PCI 4 to properly work on your PC. I found that this card is not what is advertised, and I had to return it. Example would be in a game that only uses 3600 megabytes of VRAM, having just under 8 gigs of VRAM available for performance on the GPUs function. You would think all games would run flawlessly right,, nope, some games like division 2, and assassin's Creed Valhalla will studder, or crash. The problem with this GPU is it's 192 bit bus, why make a GPU with 12 gigs of VRAM, and make it 192 bit card, makes absolutely no sense. Point being is that additional VRAM to help the card perform is utterly useless because of the 192 but bus. I ended up replacing it with a Red Devil 6900 XT ultimate. The 6700 XT elite is still a decent card for the casual gamer, and would still recommend getting one. If your expectations are this card will play every game at higher settings to ultra settings at high fps, it won't."

I learned that there are half and full PCI slot.\n2. When you install the NVIDIA driver (Search site of NVIDIA is not at all user friendly), you will get the bad 640X480. It will tell you it does not work for this platform (I had Windows 10 64 bit, could not believe it!), but will work after the reboot.\n3.

I don't know what people are talking about, this is not a noisy card. To start, I think you need to know what i'm dealing with:\n\nHAF912 case with 2x200mm fans (front&top), 1x120mm fan venting out back. the 140mm fan on my evo cpu cooler makes more noise at rest. (2600x, 16GB 3000CL15, Gigabyte Aorus MB, 750W)\n\nI mention this because, unlike most \"beauty/display\" cases with glass sides, mine is full of holes...literally. Lots of air is flowing in and out; 200mm fans push so much air at lower frequency that my case temps never exceed 35'C. As you can imagine, the latent/standing air is relatively cool compared to gpu&cpu temps and heat exchangers have access to cooler air.\nDuring demanding gaming sessions, the Pulse will ramp up and hit ~72'C and the fans will kick in and sustain at 80%, but fan noise is less my old GPU (my GTX980 caps at 84'C all the time and with smaller fans going at 100%=more high pitched whine). Not that any of that matters since most gamers have headsets and can't hear their computer.\nHonestly, I can still hear enemy footsteps on my mediocre (but very good value) mpow eg8 headset. Granted my computer is on the floor so sound has to travel a bit and bounce off some surfaces before it hits me in the head.\nI'd add a photo (cuz the red 'sapphire' looks good with my red led fans, cpu cooler and mb) but for some reason, amazon isn't accepting any of my photo formats.\nGames i play: overwatch, destiny2, gears of war5, apex (1440p, med/high, 144hz)\n\nps. if you are having issues: update your mb bios, radeon driver, windows 10\n\nUPDATE: 4weeks later. I did have an issue. I was playing overwatch and it crashed...hundreds of hours playing on my 980 and I've never had a game crash. Anyway, updated AMD drivers and after >40hrs of play, it looks solid. Updates are great; very subjective observation, but images look sharper. Will update again in 2020.\n\nUPDATE: This update is earlier than i said but i had to share my experience as i just upgraded to 27\" 1440p 144hz Acer monitor. Just awesome, overwatch just became a lot easier. Those snipers wayyyyy out there...i can see them now! Wow. If i had known what a difference more pixels would make,i would have updated earlier! The Pulse is keeping up just fine, no lag, no tearing, no issues but i do play on medium settings, 144hz, 1440p. Now,when i watch movies that are 720 or 1080, sometimes i can see lines in static scenes (is it my new monitor or gpu...i dont know), anything with motion is awesome. I also tried watching 4k videos at 144hz and those didnt look too hot either. Gaming good, im soo happy!\n\nUPDATE: 12.19.19: well, things are going south fast. my love affair with all things AMD is now over...with the recent update to 19.12.2, i'm getting monitor failure during routine use (web browsing/Netflix). when I swap out my sapphire pulse rx5700xt for my old and trusty gtx980, no problem. but the recent update is causing a ton of \"no signal detected\" issues from GPU. failure with hdmi and dp cables that work fine on gtx980. thought it might have been monitor (Acer 27\" gaming monitor (ED273UR)), but swapped that out for my old msi 27\" and same signal failure :( sooooo, now I've dropped the rating from 5 stars to 1. I'm starting communications with Sapphire Tech; obviously this failure happened outside the return window.\n\nUPDATE: 12.20.19: updated to radeon driver 19.12.3 finally, all that \"no signal detected\" messiness and black screen stuff is gone. I was 'this close' to buying an RTX2070S...and to be honest, if I had known I was going to encounter these kind of crashes every time AMD tries to optimize the GPU drivers for 'this game' or 'that game', i'd have stayed with Nvidia (even though I really, really, really hate their pricing model). Another thing i've noticed is that the RX5700XT isn't tracking with the RTX2070S...it used to when it was first released and everyone who had one was dropping it into a hot gaming rig, but with the advent of 3rd party/custom GPU's, test data from Userbenchmark and Passmark have the RX57000XT more on par with the 2060S/2070. Either that or the driver updates for the 2070S are doing much better for that product line. I've cautiously upgraded to 3-stars, and my advice is: if you are on a budget for a GPU that can handle your gaming on high/ultra on a 1440p/144hz monitor this is a decent card (per GPU-Z: my card never exceeds 83'C (hot spots), GPU ~80'C max temp). if you can find it for under $379 (as of 12/20/19), that's good value. if you can afford it, go 2070S/2080S and you'll never look back.\n\nUPDATE: 12/23/19. Finally figured it out...it was the AMD Radeon Adrenalin 2020 App, so don't install it! It was causing black screens during games, freezing game, disconnecting from monitor. Uninstalled it and all that goes away, in fact, GPUZ says my 'hotspot temp' dropped a couple degrees. Only load up latest Radeon drivers, Windows and BIOS; don't touch any AMD add on apps (ie. Adrenalin or Ryzen Master crap). I still have buyers remorse, I should have stayed Nvidia and got a RTX2070S :(\n\nUPDATE: 3/10/20. I did it. I bought an EVGA RTX2080Super; I know...for the price of the Sapphire Pulse and the EVGA 2080S, I could have bought a RTX2080Ti, not my first stupid mistake, but it's the last time I buy an AMD GPU. I'll try to resell the Pulse RX5700XT to recoup some of the cost. I'm sure it's a great graphic card for some ppl for what they want, but it keeps crashing on the games I like to play...right in the middle of comp games, so I'm very sorry AMD; you make great CPU's and I think the GPU hardware is good but the drivers are unstable when a game or application push your GPU -->black screen/freeze/bsod, take your pick. All those artifacts on my screen that I thought were incompatibility issues -gone- I can now view 4k/120hz video on my 2k monitor without any stutter or lag. If I sound bitter, I am, this experiment cost me over $1200 and I never want to see another AMD GPU again!! This is me signing off, best of luck."

I'd been on a GTX 1080 (non-TI) before this and wanted to try something new (and sell the 1080 before it depreciated anymore). The 5700xt is fast, in a lot of cases, faster than my previous 1080. Sometimes by as much as a solid 15fps in 4K gaming, which is more than I really expected based on what I'd read. It's also hot as heck.\nWhat is it with AMD and hot running GPU's?\nBut the temps are manageable if you have any kinda case airflow, and the cards seem to be over-volted from the factory so an evening of monkeying around and I found a comfortable 1900ish mhz game clock with reasonable temps. Cooler is ok, little loud. Actually a LOT loud compared to my MSI gtx 1080, but this was a $400 card, so hey.\n\nWhat I can't fix, are AMD's drivers.\n\nI love em, really I do, AMD, but they manage to have some of the same driver issues I had with my 290x(!) all these\nyears later. It's, almost impressive. Nothing completely debilitating, just annoyances. Things that make it feel like a more budget experience. The new radeon software is slick, it's got all sorts of neat stuff going on, wattman is ok, it's all\nreally fine to me. But some random wonkiness in drivers is really annoying.\nHitches in some, but not all, games/benchmarks.\nDual monitors have the ram speed at max all the time, it never clocks down, and it's not the refresh rate issue\nthat you see referenced online, both mine are 60hz screens.\nThe fan rpm isn't reported correctly, in any software, 0rpm shows 150rpm or so.\nI've seen fan curves in wattman ignored, and they don't seem to reference the stated gpu temp but rather the other higher one, the name of which I forget.\nMisreported speeds here and there for some of the other monitoring tools I use.\nThe hitches in games are the worst.\nThey aren't consistent, it's not something else running in the background, windows is fresh, etc, etc, etc.\nThe use experience just lacks the polish and just works that Nvidia has had for a long time now.\nIt's ok, it was relatively cheap for the horsepower, and I like to swap sides now and again, but\nit would really help a lot to not find so many people online with the same issues on what is basically\nthe best they have to offer right now.\n\nThe temps the card runs at, and how fast it gets there, completely borked my software fan controls that used the GPU temp as part of the data to set case fan speeds, that's been a challenge to get set back up reasonably.\nIf you're a tinkerer, plan on some time put in to get this thing to where you'll be happy.\nYou can just stick it in and use some presets, or do nothing, and it'll work (loudly), but there's really\na lot more to be had with some tuning.\n\nOverall I'm ok with it. I sold my 1080 for almost enough to buy this one, and I imagine in six months or a year this one will be worth more than said 1080 would be(hard to guess at used gpu markets).\nIf I had to buy one, outright for cash money on a new build right now, I'd probably buy something from Nvidia to be honest. I wish that wasn't so, and I am glad to have an all AMD box again after so long, but they still have a way to go.\n\nOh and don't try to run 4K games on this, you can, I do, but it's really not enough card, at all, for it unless you enjoy monkeying with settings and using upsampling and such(which works really well tbh).\nI'm sure it's a beast at 1080p and likely plenty at 1440. It's also probably quieter at lower resolutions where it isn't straining so much."

Looking at Globalwattman does have me concerned about the junction temp , which NVIDIA never shows on their monitoring software. I figured all of the youtubers say its fine so it is. AMD is not famous for its drivers though and it shows. The drivers , even the latest driver as of today 19.2.3, is buggy. At least over time there will be performance gains, unlike NVIDIA where they seemingly gimp their older hardware.\n\nThis card easily beats a 1080. Matches a 2070 /super in some titles. Im still messing around with clocking and undervolting it so it runs cooler but again the drivers are wonky and the thing wont boost to the clocks I set it to boost to. Its easier to just leave that on auto and ramp up some fan curve for better cooling. I do recommend maxing out the memory clock If you can. It makes all the difference. Also don't operate in hot rooms. Seems like there is an exponential increase in temps if your room isn't in standard room temperature , 69f-77f.\n\nUpdate!\n\nIn order for this GPU to work properly you will have to have it operate at 1440p or higher resolutions. The card simply wont boost at 1080p. Also sometimes the card will drop boost even at stock settings , which is when you go into your Wattman and change your clocks to your stable undervolt settings or back up to stock. It seems as when you run into a frame drop that stays low you need to go in Wattman and change the profile to another setting for it to fix the boost malfunction. Always run the latest driver. Always use Enhanced Sync and do not use freesync. Freesync causes latency and you don't want that in competitive games.\n\nWhen you buy AMD it is because you know what you are doing and know how to tinker with hardware. If you buy Nvidia you pretty much just stick it into your motherboard and play.\n\nI like this GPU. It runs quiet. It runs fairly cool at a standard ambient temp room. It undervolts easily(anyone can do it without worrying about messing something up) for further cooling. Tons of guides online to help you out with any problems.\n\nBuying this GPU right now is a good choice compared to other competitors around this price point. No raytracing? that's ok. There is no game out there today or in the near future that is going to require it. Nvidia and AMD are nowhere near capable of actually being able to harness full Ray tracing in their cards. Simply, there is no game out there that has the whole game ray traced. Maybe water reflection or certain shadows for a tree may be ray traced but nothing else in the game is for example."

Aparrenllty Rx 5700 cards and Rx 5700 xt card have the issue where there pretty much rendered useless if you don't update it so if you don't have internet once you get this card up in running it will practically act as if your card wasn't even plugged into your motherboard so that's something you have to be aware of."

I really enjoy the look and performance of the HARDWARE, Sapphire did a really good job on it.\n\nNow... As far as AMD goes and their software ie drivers for this card.. This is where it all goes down hill super fast. It is VERY possible that in 3 months or 6 months from now that AMD will finally get their act together and this card will easily be 5 stars. Until then however, this card is not worth the money you are paying for it. I REALLY wanted to like this card as my monitor supports Freesynch.\n\nI did a clean install using DDU and shut off my internet so windows would not try to pull drivers and installed the latest AMD software. World of Warcraft ran \"okay\" although did have 4 crashes in the past few weeks. I can honestly say I've not had wow crash on me with a graphic error in YEARS. There were also multiple times while just watching Youtube that the graphics driver failed and recovered. There were multiple cases where my screen would just go black and the only way to get things back was to force shut off the system. Modern Warfare would crash with DEV errors left and right, Division 2 would just up and crash with a graphics error.\n\nSo last week I did a new install of the OS, reinstalled all my games vs launching them off their already installed drives so everything was nice and clean. Had wow crash on me twice, had 3 blue screens, Modern Warfare would crash constantly, Division 2 (AMD game) crashed on me 3 times in a 30 minute period, and had the \"black screen\" happen a hand full of times. The black screen is the big deal breaker, having to force shutdown a PC is just not good for overall system health.\n\nKeep checking the reviews, I would hands down recommend the card once AMD gets their drivers situated. For the money you really cannot find something better, the 5700XT is a great GPU. Until then guess I'm going back to NVIDA..."

Games like Doom 2016 gets me a solid 200 fps at Ultra settings in the Vulcan API. (At 1440p). Considering my monitor is 144hz it's more than enough. Get a free sync panel and enjoy the performance. I play everything at the highest setting because I can but this look just as good at high settings and ot performs even better on other games. Borderlands 3 benchmark at Ultra Settings gets over 65ish fps with my card undervolted. Obviously high settings is reasonably comparable and looks just as good at 1440p but it's just for benchmarking to give an idea of what the thing is capable of. I'm running a r5 1600 AF for my cpu so obviously an upgrade to a r5 3600 would net me some gains in fps but it handles very well with that cpu. I'd reccomend this card to anyone not looking to spend 500+ on a RTX 2700 super. Obviously if you need Nvidias encoder for video than that's a different story. But at right around 400 this card is definitely a better option if all you do is game and are on a budget but still want 1440p performance. The new drivers as of last month solved alot of the issues people were having (I wasnt having any). Check out gamers nexus 5700xt rundown on the different models if you are thinking of a different model. They are not all created equally. Overall very happy with this card. Would definitely reccomend."

I bought this for GPU rendering and it hasn't disappointed me yet, however keep in mind that if you plan on buying this for a GPU rendering rig might want to consider an NVIDIA 2070 or 2070ti nothing less than that. Reason I say that is because most engines don't support AMD....yet, so like for example in Maya 2020 the new Arnold will let you do GPU rendering but only supports Nvidia. I have been using AMDs ProRender for my GPU rendering fix oh and VRay Next workss too if memory serves. Now why did I only put 4 stars, simply because with the AMD promotion Raise the Game Amazon never fulfilled their end of the bargain and I never got my free game despite the numerous attempts at customer service all leading to the same conclusion that they can't do anything about it and it's on the marketing department who STILL yet to contact me and it's been 2 months now. Best advice is whenever it comes to promotions stay away from Amazon you're better off going with Newegg, they literally give you no trouble about it. I should've went with them but sadly it's way too late and I'm out my promotional free game."

But I can see how it could bother other people)\n\nTl;Dr: If you are ok with doing some tinkering and googling this is a very solid card.

I have used Sapphire Tech GPUs since I have started PC rig building in the early 2000ks and have YET to be disappointed with them. Last Sapphire card I had was an RX580 8G crossfired with another 580 and that set up lasted me four years and I just wanted a new toy haha !\n\n5700 XT is easy to install and easy to OC. Word of warning though: This card is huge like the original XBOX so make sure you have space in your case ! No cooling issues, unlike MSI or other brands where you have to remove the heatsink and reapply pads or paste. I have NEVER had to do that with any Sapphire GPUs.\n\nSapphire, you are awesome and thank you for sticking with making Radeon GPUs !"

Most cards that have an output layout like this are fake and, seeing reviews from people saying it won't run DX11, I'm inclined to believe this isn't even a 6770 as those did run DX11. The listed clock speed is about 200mhz lower than the original cards which, at best, points to these being faulty cards flashed with a different BIOS to operate at a lower clock speed. HD 5770s and 6770s (same card with 2 names) also NEVER came with 4GB of VRAM.\n\nAgain, this points to this being a card with a fake BIOS. I've tested another faked GPU claiming to be a GTX 960 4GB and the card even reported itself as such to the computer. In actuality it was a GT640 with 1GB of VRAM. When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash.

Not only was I able to get my system up and running, I was also able to play a few of my favorite games, like BeamNG.drive. Granted, the settings were on Low and some on Medium, and the FPS wasn't optimal, but it was definitely playable.\n\nWhile I wouldn't recommend this as a primary card for gaming, it makes a great backup."

Installing this card resolved the performance issues. I was pleased enough with that purchase that I bought one for my home computer to resolve some lag issues when playing 4K video on my old PC. This card resolved that issue, too. I don't know how this product benchmarks against the completion. I didn't do any testing like that. I simply had performance issues with applications that needed a graphics card performance boost. The price was right on this graphics card and I found that it worked fine to resolve those issues.\n\nThe only issue that I had was that the package came with no English instructions, no drivers and no software. I am an IT technician by trade, so I had little trouble finding the right drivers and software online. On one PC, Windows Update found the drivers, but I still had to download and install the correct version of the Radeon software. On the other PC I had to download both the drivers and software. So, this wasn't much of a problem for me, but it may be more than a novice PC users can deal with.\n\nThis product did what I needed and I've had no problems with it either at home or at work. It gets a 5 star rating from me even though I would have expected better instructions for installing the product and obtaining the correct drivers & software."

Wer VR m\u00f6chte MUSS mehr investieren !\n\nDennoch m\u00f6chte ich diese Grafikkarte einmal f\u00fcr ihre erstaunliche und herausragende Leistung loben.\nHier hat MAXSUN alles richtig gemacht!\n\nIch habe einen Rechner mit ordentlich Leistung und nat\u00fcrlich auch mit einer entsprechenden Grafikkarte um damit die Valve Index VR-Brille zu betreiben. Ich bekam ein ausrangiertes Fujitsu Esprimo C710 mit USB3.0 und einem betagten aber ausreichenden Prozessor und suchte nun nach einer Low Profile Grafikkarte, die dabei auch noch schlank und bestm\u00f6gliche Leistung bringen sollte.\n\nMein verr\u00fcckter Plan:\nWenn an meinem Rechner was abraucht, sollte der kleine Esprimo das Ganze \u00fcberbr\u00fccken.\nMit 32GB RAM und der MAXSUN Radeon RX 550 ist mir das sehr gut gelungen.\nWir reden hier nat\u00fcrlich von minimalistischen Grafikeinstellungen ABER BeatSaber, Phasmophobia (SinglePlayer), Pistol Whip und Blade & Sorcery sind durchaus spielbar und die Karte wird dabei nicht \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig hei\u00df. Half Life - Alyx hingegen lagt sehr deutlich (wie es auch zu erwarten ist)\n\nDies ist keine Kaufempfehlung f\u00fcr VR, es soll aber verdeutlichen, was die kleine Karte auf dem Kasten hat.\nDenn hier schl\u00e4gt sie die vergleichbare GT 1030 um l\u00e4ngen. F\u00fcr Titel wie Diablo III und Co ifinde ich die RX 550 v\u00f6llig in Ordnung und sie macht dort auch eine echt gute Figur.\n\nFazit: Es gibt nat\u00fcrlich deutlich st\u00e4rkere Grafikkarten, egal ob AMD oder NVIDIA aber wer bei dem aktuellen Auf und Ab der Grafikkartenpreise eine g\u00fcnstige und verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig starke Grafikkarte sucht, weil er sich gerade keine gro\u00dfe leisten kann oder wie bei mir f\u00fcr einen kleineren Zweitrechner, sollte hier gut bedient sein."

Badly.\nTo be fair here, the 10-series were not built for 4K. But it needs to be said: it is one thing to do static work on 4K resolutions; once you go to a high-quality media display this is not the card you are looking for.\n\nSo this card does what it needs to do - and it will perform fine for most things in resolutions under 4k.

Not only would this cause incredible stress on such a small plug, but the adapter is so wide that it is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONNECT BOTH PLUGS INTO THE GRAPHICS CARD AT THE SAME TIME.\n\nYes folks, somebody decided to 'go cheap' on the (inexpensive) adapter which rendered their product 'half functional'. In order to make use of both ports, you will either have to cut off the side of the larger cable (including the thumbscrew) or buy a new Mini DisplayPort adapter that has the short cable between the two plugs. (This is the recommended option as the cable will reduce the stress on the mini plug that connects to the graphics card.).\n\nOther than this major problem, the card seems to work OK."

I'd like to return it and try something else, but scared of going through the process again.\nMy normal configuration is four 2560x1440 displays (and it took difficulty and extra expense to get this card even that far). But I was hoping for a card that supports 5 or 6 such displays, because I'd like to be able to temporarily connect one or two extras for certain activities.\nMy son talked me out of a less expensive card with 6 DP connectors and 6x2560x1440 support promised, because that card was based on an obsolete chip set. Likely that would have been a better choice (but I still don't know).\nI have 2 displays that fully support DP daisy chaining, plus 2 that can be either last or alone, but not first. When I got the card, I had short enough DP cables that they only reached by daisy chaining one pair, putting the 3rd alone on a DP and the 4th on HDMI. That worked beautifully when I added the monitors while already logged into Win10. But either rebooting or resuming from sleep with the 2nd display on gave no display and only recoverable by killing power to everything then turning on all but the 2nd display, then logging in before turning on display 2. Lots of experimentation and tweaks got me to the point that only the HDMI display (4) was lost (until next full power cycle reboot) if I made the mistake of resuming with display 2 on. Still not usable.\nSo I bought a longer DP cable so I could have two DP daisy chains and no HDMI. A lot of experimentation got that to almost but not quite usable. So I also got a longer HDMI cable, to get to each display on its own cable (like normal people would). That got rid of most of the resume from sleep malfunctions and by then I had learned enough about the relevant registry entries to get rid of the rest of the resume from sleep issues with some registry kludges.\nClearly this hardware supports 7 different positions for connecting displays despite having only 4 connectors. But the driver is too filled with bugs regarding any DP daisy chaining. Something (maybe driver, maybe chipset) also is more fundamentally limited to a total of 5 at once. Adding and removing connections while logged in showed it can see/identify all 7 at once, but will only display on 5 at once. Even 5 is not practical for normal use. It only works when you bring in the 5th while logged in. You can neither log in nor resume from sleep if the 5th is already there.\nLots more annoying, but not show stopping, problems are still there in the basically usable 4 display config I have after buying two extra cables I hadn't expected to need.\nAll of those seem to be driver bugs. A few of them are discussed online as being Windows 10 bugs. But using similar Nvidia based multi display systems, I never saw those bugs before, so I expect that online info is wrong and they are all Radeon driver bugs."

I tried multiple releases of drivers, but no luck: any time the card was enabled the screen would immediately go to black on start up. Once it went black, I had to restart in safe mode & disable the card.\n\nAfter a week of fighting with it I reached out to AMD to see if there was anything they could do - no response, but they released new drivers on 1/21, and that seems to have done the trick, after a complete removal of all previous drivers and a fresh install of the new ones.\n\nSo ultimately; the card is now working and seems to be working as advertised - solid entry level GPU, however I don't know if it was worth the amount of time I sunk into it took to get it working. If I can avoid it, I won't be buying any AMD products again, and I'd highly recommend looking through posts on the AMD community before pulling the trigger on this card."

The Quadro GPUs are the same as the Geforce GPUs, but certain features pertinent to cad, video editing, rendering, mostly using OpenGL, are enabled by (accessed by) the Quadro driver. This card has more CUDA cores, but less memory bandwidth and lower speed than the Geforce GTX-980.\n\nGeforce cards are gaming cards, where they excel. That is the only application in which they excel. Otherwise, Quadro blows Geforce away. I control this card with nvidia-settings, a Linux program written by nVidia. I only use Linux, so my experience does not apply to Windows.\n\nIf you really want to push this card, you should remove the cover using a tiny torx driver, and redo the thermal-interfaces with AS-5. THEN IT WILL REALLY SMOKE! Not literally. The K4200 is a lot of card for the money. To give an idea of it's rank, I get about 3200 on Unigine Heaven benchmark.\n\nThe fastest nVidia GPUs for gaming rack up around 10,000. Anyone can download Unigine Heaven and run it on their PC. THEN you have a starting point to work from. The Unigine site has a list of many video cards and their scores running Heaven; mostly Geforce cards, but a few Quadro.\n\nBut it's a rock solid choice, even for gaming. The Quadro line was always more stable than Geforce, had greater computing power, and features not available in Geforce models"

For reference, I paired this up with a Framework laptop for testing, and I used Linux as the OS of choice. Initial OS issues aside, this did a decent job. With a decent (don't waste money on a high end GPU) GPU, it can easily improve or outperform the onboard graphics present on many laptops. However, don't forget its one major limitation: data throughput. The PCIe port is only 4-lane, and Thunderbolt 3 is limited to the same. Don't tout Thunderbolt 4 when it comes to this kind of usage; In reality, Thunderbolt 4 is a poor performer when it comes to eGPUs because it doesn't increase throughput and also it holds back an entire data channel for other purposes, resulting in LESS bandwidth for your eGPU. That's a Thunderbolt design standard, not a fault of this device.\n\nJust pair this chassis with a decent GPU designed around an x4 PCIe slot. Once you do that, you'll get surprisingly good performance from this little case. Also remember not to unplug it without shutting down the laptop first. eGPU hotplug is not yet reliable, and that's on Windows. It's entirely non-existent on Linux.\n\nThe cable that comes with it is short (1m), but this is somewhat by requirement. If you need a longer cable, spend the money for something well-made and don't go cheap. With the bandwidth this device uses, quality cables are critical. Also, don't plan to put this chassis distant from the laptop. You won't find a cable longer than 2m. If you do, it's a scam. Look up the specs for Thunderbolt 3 if you don't want to believe my word. A 2m length cable is the longest length supported, and that is backed up by testing and design requirements. Adding extenders to break that limit will only result in problems.\n\nThe chassis is solid metal, but the design has some issues. You'll need to remove one or both side plates to install your GPU (and maybe a SATA drive for the adventurous; there is no mounting bracket but there is a port). The side panels are structural for this device, but the fittings aren't that solid. Yes, that means it does warp over time. There will be gaps that form, and it's not going to keep perfect appearance for long. However, it is stable enough to work without risk of it collapsing or warping too severely on its own.\n\nPeople complained about the 1Gb Ethernet port being glitchy. This may have been the case on previous drivers, and I've experienced them with the same chipset on other devices. However, the network here stayed connected and perfectly reliable over testing that lasted multiple weeks. Hopefully this means that a driver update has sorted out all of the issues.\n\nOverall: Let your need be your guide on this. It's a good, solid platform, but it's not without its limitations. Simply put, you're not going to get an equivalent to a high-end gaming workstation's performance."

If you have an older TB3 ultrabook, stay away.\n\nFirst of all, just forget about using any of the expansion ports on this thing. If you're building a laptop docking station, just get a USB-C hub for the rest of your stuff. The ports don't work at all on Windows, and while I did get them to work on MacOS, my keyboard still flickered out every 30 seconds. The fact of the matter is, the GPU needs to use as much of the TB3 bandwidth as possible to maximize performance, and anything else you connect takes away from that. It's actually the same logic board that the Sonnet 550 uses, but Sonnet chose not to include the expansion ports because of the issues.\n\nI tested it with my Macbook and with an older HP Spectre x360. On the Mac, it's plug-and-play except for the ports being finnicky, the GPU works like a charm. But when connected to the Spectre, it doesn't even power on. Just makes repeated clicking noises. This might be related to the TB3 controller on the Spectre going through the PCH versus the direct line to the CPU in the Macbook. Doesn't seem to be a faulty PSU like other reviewers have reported though.\n\nFinally, the build quality is about what you expect for the cheapest eGPU box you can get. Installation of the GPU requires taking out quite a few screws, and the whole thing is made of a cheap-looking powdercoated metal that scuffs and scratches very easily. It's also got a very obnoxious blue power LED on the front, which is fortunately very easy to disable by unplugging the blue/white wire from the logic board.\n\nBottom line: This unit seems picky about which laptops it wants to work with. I got lucky, but I'd say it's worth the extra 60 bucks for the Core X if you don't want to take that chance."

You can hear it when it's working hard, but it's not annoying, better than a full PC I would say.\n\nThe ethernet port seems to work without any issues. I have had a few instances where it drops out and I have to reboot to get it back. But it's happened maybe 2-3 times since I've been using it. I also suspect this is due to the power in my home not being so great.\n\nThe USB ports I have to review pretty critically, they're full USB 3.0 which is great, and you can get full USB 3.0 speeds with them, however, the power they produce is really not great, if I plug my phone in to charge, I will usually have less power on my phone after a few hours. The power issue can be problematic especially with devices that need extra power when they're working harder, like a portable disk drive. This was solved by getting a powered USB 3.0 hub. So a separate power supply handles that and just uses a USB jack on the box to plug into.\n\nFor the PCI-E performance, I don't have too many issues with this. I think performance on a full PC would be better, but as an EGPU, I have no complaints at all.\n\nSome details about my day to day use of this.\nMy OS is Manjaro Linux, I use an AMD Radeon 580 GTS, I use 2 4k TVs and a 1080p monitor (No screen tearing or lag with this setup)."

It did take a few days.\nTemps are decent for air cool. Junction temps: roughly 85C+. Edge temps roughly 60c. At 2500mhz +.\nRadeon Software is great. I've been using that more.\n\nCons:\nMSI Afterburner Voltage Control didn't work. I had to copy and paste a set of commands into a Profile File \"VEN_...\" found in the Profile sub directory of MSI Afterburner folder to get it to recognize my gpu voltage. It reset the file which recognize this card. Using the Checkbox \"Unlock voltage monitoring\" and rebooting did not work. Nor did tweaking the MSIAfterburner.cfg. This wasn't a problem with my other card. This is important because MSI Afterburner Software is showcased as the Software for this video card.\n\nThis thing does get warm if you don't have good airflow.\nIt does require a brace of some kind to prevent sagging.\nNot clear on how to control the RBG effects on the card. Not much of a con for me though.\n\nNotes:\nYou do need to use the bracket to keep it from sagging. I couldn't use it because I had another pcie device plugged in. So I had to improvise. Not much of a con but worth noting.\n\nMax OC is about 2600mhz. Anything higher requires a water block.\nThe card is taller then most. So, screwing it into the chassis will be a bit tighter\nKeep in mind this requires 3 (not 2) pcie connectors.\n\nIf MSI reads this please invest in making a waterblock for this gpu (6900xt Gaming Trio Z). This card has more potential if keep cool."

The first thing I do when I buy a new card is put it in a machine test it out with cinebench or one of many decent programs and even those list the ram as DDR6.\n\nThe rig i put this in is a bit dated. Specs are as follows.\nAmd fx 8350---- clock 4000mhz\nMotherboard -----Asus 990 evo r.2\nRam 16gb corsair vengeance 1600mhz\nThe monitor used was a dell 24in wide in 1440p\nAnd the hard drive is a Samsung evo 500 gb.\nAnd the power supply is a evga 850 watts gold rated with a year warranty.\n\nThe games tested were fortnight because thats all my kids want to play. But I also ran elder scrolls online.\n\nOn fortnite we got a stable 120 fps but would spike as high as 140 fps. The game was set to high quality.\n\nThe other game I tested was Elder scrolls online but I didn't hang around the old areas I went to Northern Elsweyr because there is finer detail there. Thats not to say the old original area look bad they hold up well for a mmo. I just wanted as much texture detail and draw distance at the same time to see what the card could do. I set the graphics to epic and I had a stable 70 fps but spiked up too 100 fps and these were frames in combat with plenty of effects like flame staff and other casting effects in air.\n\nI also have a feeling this card can do even more but I think its bottlenecked. I didnt bother throwing it in my machine to test it i have a newer Ryzen. If I do I will update this review.\n\nFor a casual gamer this card is great amd even pushes past casual in my opinion. If I had to use this card personally I wouldn't mind, its a solid card for its price range and capabilities.\n\nLike I said the other review is wrong about the memory type"

My 7-year-old rig has a new lease on life with this GPU. If you're looking for an extremely solid mid-range card at a budget price, then look no further.\n\nThe relatively low power consumption and operating temps are surprising considering its capabilities. The only real point of contention is the 4GB of VRAM--even though it is GDDR6.\n\nI've noticed inaccurate or misleading descriptions on several of these, but I can confirm that is indeed EVGA's version of the 1650 Super. Be careful when shopping around, because some have been suckered into purchasing the far weaker base 1650,\n\nAgain, the 1650 SC Ultra is a great 1080p card at a nice price for old and new machines alike."

I did carefully choose this card because its the updated version that runs GDDR6 instead of the previous GDDR5. Even though it's only 4GB, it performs so much better after watching performance reviews online.\n\nIf I was to spend any more than this, I would choose the next best value with NVENC hardware encoding - the RTX 2060. I picked one up last month and am very happy. NVIDIA has a program called Geforce Experience that makes installing/updating drivers super easy with even more features built-in.

FX 570 are good cards, but they are 6 years old, so I wanted to upgrade to something faster and also I want to have one card (not two), which will drive all 3 monitors.\nBy having only one card I will save in power usage too.\nBecause all nVidia cards prior to Kepler series were only capable to drive 2 monitors I was forced to go to K2000.\nK2000 is the cheapest Quadro card which can drive 3 monitors.\nYou can ask: why nVidia, not AMD?\nI've tried AMD. The cheapest AMD card which can drive 3 monitors is V4800.\nI've bought it and also bought 2 Active DisplayPort to DualLink DVI adapters (Bizlink).\nOn paper V4800 should be capable to drive 3 DVI monitors using active DisplayPort to DualLink DVI adapters, but I was not able to make it work. Two monitors were fine with AMD card, but I want 1 card, not two.\nI've tried different drivers and different configuration (Spend several days trying to change drivers and switch monitors and cables and adapters). Sometimes after reboot it will drive 3 monitors, but after 10 min or so it will drop 3rd monitor without any reason and even reboot will not help.\nI don't know why AMD claimed they support 3 DVI motors, it was not working for me.\nMay be it was my specific V4800 card, but I don't want to buy one more card and end up with the same result.\nAfter struggling with AMD, I've decided to try nVidia, but because I want only 1 video card, my cheapest choice was K2000.\nI was preparing to fight with nVidia too, because of the bad experience with AMD.\nTo my surprise nVidia K2000 worked without any issue at all.\nJust plug and play. So now I have one card which drives 3 DVI monitors\nOne 2560x1600 monitor using DVI output directly\nOne 2560x1600 monitor using DisplayPort through active DispalyPort to DVI output adapter\nOne 1600x1200 monitor using DisplayPort through Active DispalyPort to DVI output adapter.\nAlso all my 3 DualLink DVI cables are very long 50' (cables are from monoprice (item 2185), because my workstation is in the garage, but monitors are in the office.\nMay be my long cables were a reason why 3 DVI monitors did not work with V4800, but 2 monitors were fine with long cables on V4800.\nBy moving from two FX 570 cards to K2000 I've saved about 40W of power consumption or about 20$ per year. (I'm assuming I'm using workstation for about 12 hours per day)\nApril 30, 2014:\nAfter couple of days DualLink DVI monitor from DisplayPort disaapered in the same way as V4800.\nAfter some trouble shutting, and swapping DisplayPort to DVI adapter K2000 started working again, but after 3 hours it happens again, I've just rebooted computer and now for 2 days it is working again in the highest resolution.\nSo I've decreased rating to two stars from 3 stars after disappearance of the third monitor.\nBut the third monitor disappeared differently on nVidia then on AMD. If I will decrease resolution, it will continue working, but in AMD case nothing will resurrect monitor.\nMay 29, 2014\nAfter using this card for a month, I've added one star back (3 star card)\nOne monitor 3007WFP disappeared (went blank scree) several times, but I found way to fix it:\nI put both my 3007WPF monitors on DisplayPorts, after doing that 3007WPF monitors will stop disappearing, even putting them back was easy, just changing resolution twice: to 1280x800 and back to 2560x1600.\nMay be a reason for monitor disappearance is a combination of long cables 50' and an old Dell monitor: 3007WFP.\nBecause after adding Dell U3011 it will not disappear.\nNow I connected three 30\" dell monitors to this card.\nU3011 to DVI connector and two 3007WFP to Display ports.\nDisplay port connectors have active DisplayPort to DVI adapters and there are 50\" DVI cable to drive U3011 and two 3007WPF monitors.\nBefore if one of the 3007WFP monitors were on DVI it will go blank after some time, but this problem is not happening with U3011.\nProbably signal was too week for 3007WFP, but fine for U3011.\nJan 19, 2015\nFor several months my setup with 3 x 30\" monitors is running fine.\nU3011 on Dual Link DVI\nand both 3007WFP on display ports with active DisplayPort to Duallink DVI converters.\nAnd all three monitors are on 50' dual link dvi cable from Monoprice.\nOccasionally once in 2 months on wake up from a sleep mode one 3007WFP monitor will show double pictures, but changing resolution to 1280 x 800 and back to 2560 x 1600 will fix this issue."

I spent a lot of time researching the cards that were compatible with the software, and then cross-referencing them with the prospective motherboards to be as certain as possible that the build would go off without a hitch.\n\nThe 1st K2000 was DOA. Computer wouldn't even boot with it installed.\nA week later, with the replacement card installed, the video was crummy and I couldn't install the drivers. I sent that card back for a refund, hesitant to order a third.\n\nA couple of days later I called PNY mainly to see if there was a known problem with a recent batch. John, possibly the best tech support guy I have ever spoken with, said there was not and listened carefully to the problems I had. He felt that he probably could have helped me through the aborted driver install on the second card, and promised that if I purchased a third card he would be available to assist me if needed. He also gave me some hints.\n\nThe conversation with John restored my confidence in PNY so I ordered another card. It arrived Monday and the driver installed with ease.\n\nSo, the PNY was not without it's trials and tribulations, but I find that's pretty well normal with electronics. Last build I had to send memory sticks back and forth for a while. As Roseanne Rosanna Danna used to say, \"It's always something.\"\n\nThe two important things to take from this are: 1) Buy from Amazon and send it back if it's defective; 2) PNY support was outstanding and that's really, really important."

After months of research, weighing price and features of NVIDIA vs.the competition, I decided to go NVIDIA. I run a team that provides modeling and simulation services to the government. All our machines use NVIDIA Quadro cards. All my technicians swear by them. I consulted other professionals and they universally recommended the Quadro series for workstation applications, mostly because of the drivers. That is the big difference with NVIDIA Quadros, their drivers. I then had to decide how much pain to endure in terms of price. I was afraid the 600-series cards would not be powerful enough for life after college and the 4,000 series prices are just cost prohibitive for me personally. As it is, this card was the single most expensive part of the build. Having said all that, I could not be more pleased. The performance on the Autodesk software my daughter uses is outstanding. No hesitation even with her most demanding 3D animation products. I didn't know much about drivers, but there are more to the Quadro drivers than just making the card work. The features and flexibility you get are unmatched in anything you would experience on your average PC. The ability to create multiple virtual desktops for your different process applications is very useful. My daughter can now have a series of applications open and diaplayed on her dual-monitor rig with a set of views for animation, another for photo editing, another for writing, all by loading the desired profile. All the apps load and the displays pop up in the precise location she wants them, all by selecting a saved profile. Buying this card was a good decision and research pays off. Building a workstation for professional use is much different than building a system for home use or gaming. Lastlyy, I had no issues whatsoever installing the card or installing the software/drivers. It worked perfectly the first time I pushed the power button."

I got it to work and the second monitor came up just fine - the first time! Now, every time I restart, turn on the monitor, or during some resuming from sleep, the second monitor won't be recognized. This happens with another known good monitor too. I see people complain about this on NVIDIA forums and they say to shut off the monitor, then unplug the video cable, then to wait a while and plug it back in, and finally turn on the monitor. That sort of works for me but is not a reliable solution and it's a hassle. Can NVIDIA get this right?\n\nI suppose my biggest complaint, however, is that performance has hardly changed. Screen refreshes are not as snappy as other older NVIDIA cards and hardware acceleration is barely any faster with this card than my old one."

It's definitely pricier than consumer cards, but works well when you use 3D design programs or even Photoshop. I don't own a Quadro 4000, but looking at the specs, the K2000 is similar with more CUDA cores at half the price (win-win).\n\nSo far the only down side is early driver issues. 30 bit color no longer works in Maya, and the Force 10-bit mode in the driver causes both Photoshop and Maya to crash. That's very disappointing, since that's why I wanted a card with two displayport outputs to drive my 30 bit enabled primary monitor and displayport only second monitor.\n\nHowever, like I've seen with the 600, drivers are updated frequently by NVidia, so I'm confident they'll get support up and running especially with their certified drivers.\n\nUnless you need the extra performance or two displayport outputs, the K600 can be had at less than half the cost and still has good performance, making it a better value in my opinion."

This product has been designed to optimize the viewport of 3D applications and it offers stellar performance for this (considering it is a 2 GB card) as well as having rock solid stability (no crashes). Additionally, it is a low profile card which means it runs at a low temperature which in turn improves stability of all other components in your system and it also has a relatively low power consumption. Great product overall and I am pretty happy with it."

It would not be recognized by my system. I bought this because it's the recommended card type for design applications. Although reviews were few and mixed, Newegg had a very impresssive video with an Nvidea representative. I have since bought an MSI GTX 760 gaming card which was also stated via reviews to work for design as well as gaming. NOTE, I have an MSI Z87 G45 gaming card and decided to use the same brand GPU. It has crossed my mind that maybe it was simply incompatible with the motherboard, but since the new card went in, so far screaming fast, crystal clear performance make me think not... Anyway, I will do more research as I am still curious what happened."

With the latest drivers and suggested utility.\n\nThe only thing that fixed this was going through a VBIOS flash to the latest 14gbps version.\n\nAfter this all the problems seemed to disappear.\n\nThe card now performs better than advertised. From 1650mhz to 1780mhz(1820 OC) and with only a 5\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C climb in temperatures. Which this card has not exceeded 61\u00b0C during long gaming sessions and 59\u00b0C during stress testing.\n\nI do recommend this card, but I wish I'd know about the bios. Instead I spent two days trying to figure out if it was incompatible with my other hardware.\n\nUpdate: I think I may have gotten a faulty card. This is the 5th GPU I've worked with, but this has been the most consistently bad card I've used.\nSo the card keeps resetting itself.\nUnderclock, overclock, undervolt, overvolt, custom fan curve, power limit, graphic settings, drivers, utilities.\nNothing seems to fix the issue of this card black screening and artifacting on anything Demanding. Such as High FPS or Ultra settings on AAA Titles.\nConstant errors all leading back to Direct x10, x11, x12 crashes, or \"device disconnected\"\nIn the end of each crash the card will revert any settings prior to the crash.\nRunning the card at stock will run low GPU dependent games. CsGO, smite, MW etc.\nWith crashes on anything demanding; GTA V, SOTR or ROTR, The Division 2, Fallout 4, Ark: SE. The list goes on. I decided to test every title I own.\nI will be refunding this card.\nI'm hoping this was just a faulty card, because in the end, I do actually like the card.\nIt gets me up to 125 to 200fps on MW, 100+ GTA V, Static 150 SMITE, 90+ultra TD2.

Having purchased at least four different variations on the 5700 XT, I\u2019ve had plenty of time to get up close and personal with AMD\u2019s NAVI architecture, as well as several of the AIB partner cards. Of the four, one didn\u2019t function properly out of the box. It was plagued by many of the issues reported in various online communities- black screens, crashing- and things that are generally reported as driver issues. Having spent my whole life in the IT field, my drivers and firmware are always up to date, and the issues with the card followed it from system to system.\n\nRather than abandon the product, I initiated an RMA and received a replacement. Amazon and the seller were completely reasonable and shipped right away.\n\nI\u2019m happy to say the replacement card was plug and play and has functioned absolutely flawlessly. The performance per dollar is great. I\u2019d buy it again or even recommend to a friend if asked for an opinion.\n\nHowever, I wouldn\u2019t assume that random crashing is a driver problem. It\u2019s well known that Asus had some QC issues with early versions of this model, but I\u2019m happy to report it seems they\u2019ve made the necessary adjustments.\n\nIf it was truly a driver problem, the issues would\u2019ve continued when the replacement was installed, but that wasn\u2019t the outcome.\n\nIt\u2019s always a bit of a headache when something doesn\u2019t work properly out of the box, but there are always going to be a percentage of failures.\n\nOverall I can\u2019t complain, as the replacement has worked perfectly."

This happened while the Crypto miners drove the price of GPU\u2019s through the roof.\n\nI have a Corsair Obsidian 750D full tower case so I have plenty of space for this RX580, an HX1200i power supply so I have more than power. My Motherboard is an ASUS Crosshair V Formula Z, with an AMD fX 9590 CPU. The installation was straight forward except I had to change cables the R9 uses 2 6 pin cables, the RX580 1 8pin cable, very nice. The 750D\u2019s has a great cable management system which routes the cables in a space accessed from the right case cover. Windows 10 was a complete PIA with the installation. When I restarted after installation Windows 10 decided it needed to repair W10 so it sat there for a half an hour doing that. I had a minor amount of trouble loading the drivers. A clean install fixed that.\n\nHuge improvement over the defective R9 380. Much better rendering. I am not a gamer but I have almost 200 GB of videos loaded. The old SD TV shows have greatly improved picture quality, very pleased.\n\nBut:\nI had one green screen of death which was apparently mitigated by a clean install of the drivers. This morning when I woke the PC up I had a flickering black screen. This is a known issue with this series of Radeon cards. I did the suggested fixes so we will see what happens. It is apparently a startup issue. I\u2019ll just let the computet go to standby instead of me putting it to sleep. This issue is the only reason for the 4 Star rating.\n\nIf I continue to have problems in the next few days I\u2019ll Call Amazon for a replacement.\n\nUpdate: The suggested fixed have worked. The most common cause of the flashing black screen, according to Youtubes on the subject is the Windows error reporting service, it is now disabled. The 2nd as much less come is iCloud on your PC. I don\u2019t usr iCloud on the PC so I deleted it."

I was averaging 50-60ish FPS with most settings on high. I personally am not looking for high FPS, just want it to look good. I assume it would be fantastic at 1080p.\n\nI would have kept the card but couldn't accept a defect with the RGB led lights. One of the perks of having this specific Asus card is the ability to change the colors to match with other RGB in a setup. Unfortunately, when set to specific colors, the LEDs didn't match. This is prevalent on most colors except for dark blue, red and green. It is hard to capture on camera but I think my uploaded pictures show how when I set the color to yellow (using Asus' software) the top of the card is green and the bottom is yellow. on white, you can see part is blue and part is white. I know someone who also has this card, and their colors look the same in these same settings. I decided to send it back because I didn't feel great about paying full price and not being able to set the color I wanted.\n\nI still rate it 4-stars because of how well it performed and how quiet it was. I know not all these cards have the defect mine did and still thought it was a great value."

You should do your own research and determine for yourself if this is the right product for you.\n\nBecause this card is already overclocked, the main problems you may face are overheating when you set the graphics settings in games too high for the card to handle and from the drivers published by AMD through their adrenaline software. If you experience overheating, you can undervolt your card to prevent it from overheating as much, lower the overall in-game graphics settings, and flip the switch on the PCB to O for energy efficiency and quietness. The P is for performance and will result in a hotter card. If you decide to overclock the card, you may want to replace the backplate for a water-cooled system of your choice to mitigate overheating.\n\nThe card was built like a beast to the point that its own design and software couldn't handle it. I bought the card for around $400, before the price inflation on GPUs. Now the card sells for over $1,000."

You do need an 6+2 Pin to power it. and one last additional thing I may add is if you want the FULLEST potential of the Radeon Freesync and Antilag features that come with the driver I would recommend an ASUS Freesync 165Hz monitor which is what I use if you\u2019re going to also buy a monitor if not It should still look great with any other monitor.

I hesitated a long time to which model was relevant based on my current configuration. I hesitated between the 3go and the 6go version. For the long run I decided to go for the 6go.\n\nThe card itself is very nice and installing it was no struggle. I was a bit worried in terms of space but it has the same size roughly as the 650Ti. The PC started with no issues. I only had issues when I wanted to install the last version of the drivers. The install failed even if I selected a brand new installation. I fixed this using Driver Cleaner PE to clean the previous drivers. It worked straight away.\n\nIn terms of performance it is clearly visible on some games (Deus Ex Mankind, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Wreckfest, Prey...) but others less (Assassin's Creed Origin, Far Cry 5).\n\nThe card is very silent, I read some comment about a noisy card...It was not the case with mine..so far. I will update this if anything changes.\n\nThe big upsetting thing was the delivery, Amazon just shipped the box of the card..with nothing around it to protect it. I received the box with the delivery document sticked directly to it. As the card is just under a thin carton protection I was worried that it could be damaged. I reported straight away the issue as I found it shocking for a product at that price and that fragile !\n\nAnyway I am very happy so far with this card ! Even if nowadays buddles are a bit cheap with no stickers or anything else..."

                    "text": "Ich bin von der GTX 650 auf die GTX 1060 umgestiegen, habe gleich mehrere Spiele getestet (Doom4, Farcry4, Bioshock Infinite) und kann nur Gutes \u00fcber die Leistung der Karte berichten. Die Bewegungen sind absolut fl\u00fcssig, selbst bei allen Einstellungen auf Ultra. Die Ger\u00e4uschentwicklung ist erfreulich gering und die von anderen Rezensenten aufgef\u00fchrten St\u00f6rger\u00e4usche treten bei mir nicht auf. Allerdings benutze ich ein externes TASCAM-Soundmodul und nicht die integrierte Soundkarte.\nDie Lieferung erfolgte innerhalb von zwei Tagen zum angek\u00fcndigten Datum. Etwas seltsam war, dass die Karte in der offenen Werksverpackung geliefert wurde, denn diese war nicht wie \u00fcblich zugeklebt. Auch die Folienverpackung der Karte selbst war nicht zugeschwei\u00dft, sondern mit einem gelben Klebstreifen verschlossen. Das l\u00e4sst vermuten, dass die Karte m\u00f6glicherweise zur\u00fcckgegeben wurde. Da sie nicht defekt zu sein scheint und auch keine Gebrauchsspuren aufweist, habe ich das erst einmal vernachl\u00e4ssigt. Im Lieferumfang befinden sich nur die Karte, ein Quick-Manual und eine Treiber-CD.\nBesitzer von kleineren PCs seien allerdings gewarnt. Man muss nicht nur die Abmessungen der Karte beachten. Auch der Aufbau des Mainboards kann die Installation erschweren bzw. vereiteln. Ich besitze einen Medion-Rechner mit dem Mainboard H77H2-EM V:1.0. Hier sind die SATA-Anschl\u00fcsse so angebracht, dass die GTX 1060 die schnellen, grauen Anschl\u00fcsse f\u00fcr die Festplatten blockiert! Ein Anschluss ist gar nicht mehr erreichbar und der zweite ist nur mit etwas Geschick und einem abgewinkelten Stecker bzw. Adapter zu benutzen. Hatte man bei diesem PC-Modell bisher zwei Platten im Geh\u00e4use, m\u00fcsste man die zweite Platte gezwungenerma\u00dfen mit den langsamen, wei\u00dfen SATA-Anschl\u00fcssen verbinden und h\u00e4tte dadurch Geschwindigkeitseinbu\u00dfen beim Zugriff. Zum Gl\u00fcck habe ich nur eine Festplatte in meinem Rechner und konnte das Problem mit einem abgewinkelten Stecker l\u00f6sen. Man sollte sich vor dem Kauf der Grafikkarte also vergewissern, dass auf dem Mainboard keine h\u00f6heren Elemente im Weg sind, die das Einstecken der Karte in den PCI-Slot blockieren k\u00f6nnen. Ein SATA-Stecker ist da bereits zuviel. Doch das ist nicht der Karte anzulasten. Die ist bekannterma\u00dfen ein ziemlicher Brocken.\n\nDie Software-Installation verlief ohne Komplikationen. Ich habe zuvor alle alten NVIDIA-Treiber im abgesicherten Modus deinstalliert, den Rechner mit der neuen Soundkarte neu gestartet und die Treiber von der CD installiert. Anschlie\u00dfender habe ich die aktuellen Updates heruntergeladen."

                    "text": "Ich habe seit f\u00fcnf Jahren einen Rechner gehabt, mit welchem es nie Probleme gab. Ganz kurze Eckdaten: 8x i7 2700K 3.50 GHz, Gigabyte Z77X-D3H Mainboard, 4x 4 GB DDR3 RAM und ehemals eine GTX 680. Damals nat\u00fcrlich schon an der Spitze der Technik aber mit 2 GB VRAM kommt man heute nicht mehr weit.\n\nAlso musste eine neue Graka her. Ich habe mich f\u00fcr dieses Modell entschieden, weil es noch recht neu ist und nicht verh\u00e4ltnim\u00e4\u00dfig teuer ist wie Andere. 6 GB VRAM sind f\u00fcr mich vollkommen ausreichend. Also direkt bestellt. Versand wie immer schnell und zuverl\u00e4ssig; leider war die Graka anscheinend Defekt. Das Netzteil liefert genug Saft (800 W). Die L\u00fcfter starteten ebenfalls nicht beim booten. Mir war bewusst, dass sich diese erst ab ca. 60\u00b0C einschalten, dennoch sollten sie direkt beim Booten kurz anspringen. Dementsprechend wurde die Graka zur\u00fcckgeschickt und der Ersatz kam sogar noch schneller an, als die Erste :) Diese wurde dann erfolgreich eingebaut und funktioniert auch. Keine Ahnung ob die erste Graka defekt war oder ich irgendwas banales \u00fcbersehen habe.\n\nDie GTX 1060 ist jetzt erst einen Tag im Einsatz aber \u00fcberzeugt bereits vollkommen. Bei Rainbow Six Siege beispielsweise werden auf Ultra konstant mehr als 100 FPS erzeugt. Am meisten getestet wurde die Graka bis jetzt an Ghost Recon Wildlans, bei dem die GTX 680 gerade auf geringen Einstellungen fl\u00fcssig lief. Das Spiel war einfach h\u00e4sslich. Mit der GTX 1060 ist Ultra kein Problem. Bis jetzt habe ich noch keine weiteren Einstellungen an der Graka selbst vorgenommen, ich bekomme immer um die 50 FPS aktuell. Die Karte wurde dabei nie w\u00e4rmer als 71\u00b0C und die L\u00fcfter sind f\u00fcr mich neben den Geh\u00e4use-L\u00fcftern nicht zu h\u00f6ren. Der maximal benutze Speicher lag schon bei 5907 MB.\n\nTrotz der Startschwierigkeiten mit dem ersten Modell kann ich hier eine klare Kaufempfehlung aussprechen. DIe Karte tut genau das was sie soll.\n\nPS: Sollte nach Einbau der Karte kein -oder ein Stanbild kommen, k\u00f6nnte es daran liegen, dass das Mainboard die Karte nicht erkennt. So war es bei mir. Bei einem 5 Jahre alten BIOS kein Wunder."

It'll play everything at that resolution on max and stays under 60c for me so far even at high load, and it's whisper quiet too. Its small form factor compared to the much larger 1070 and 1080 cards make it great for smaller cases too.\n\nGigabyte offer a three year warranty with generally great build quality, and at the price I paid it's one of the best deals for a 6GB 1060, let alone a custom cooler overclocked version like this one. My only complaint is that the description lacks what power cable it needs which is just 1 x 6 pin.\n\nOverall, this is a supremely balanced card, relatively small, very quiet, decently powerful and with 6GB of ram it offers a lot of future proofing, as even on 1080p my max setting on GTA5 uses up 4GB, so getting the 6GB version over the 3GB one makes a lot of sense too.\n\nI'm very happy with this card, even allowing for its comparative value at the time, a lot more so than I was with the 680 due to the 1060 having a smaller form factor and quieter performance, and a much lower price, it's without question the nicest pound-for-pound card I've ever owned.\n\nHighly recommended, especially at the 6% discount sale price I got it for."

It's aesthetics and lighting make it fit very well in your case, especially if you have green-based RGB in mind.\n4. The fans are silent up to around 80% speed and are very good at cooling down the GPU die.\n5. The I/O contains 3 Display ports, 1 HDMI port and a USB C port. Good selection considering what most people buying this card will have display it's output.\n\nTo sum it all up, you're guaranteed to find a higher maximum overclock due to the better silicon, perfect 1080p and 1440p gameplay with little struggle at 4K, great aesthetics, quiet fans, and a good variety in I/O ports. Perfect for builds between $1500-$2300."

Most cards that have an output layout like this are fake and, seeing reviews from people saying it won't run DX11, I'm inclined to believe this isn't even a 6770 as those did run DX11. The listed clock speed is about 200mhz lower than the original cards which, at best, points to these being faulty cards flashed with a different BIOS to operate at a lower clock speed. HD 5770s and 6770s (same card with 2 names) also NEVER came with 4GB of VRAM.\n\nAgain, this points to this being a card with a fake BIOS. I've tested another faked GPU claiming to be a GTX 960 4GB and the card even reported itself as such to the computer. In actuality it was a GT640 with 1GB of VRAM. When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash. In other words KEEP SHOPPING!"

While this card is a tad expensive it is not priced at the ridiculously insane prices of the middle to high end gaming video cards in 2022. This GPU has done the job of letting me go anywhere on the internet without video lag.\n\nI had a more expensive NVIDIA GPU in my system with otherwise state of the art hardware. The newest most power Ryzen 9 \\ 5900 CPU, fast memory and a 750 watt power supply. The NVIDIA GPU ran like hot garbage on my Ubuntu system. Ubuntu has a nasty sepia color scheme that saturates the entire OS and everything in it. It is not only ugly but painful to look at due to my vision issues.\n\nI did not know for sure at the time but, I hoped a new video card from someone other than NVIDIA might perform better. Turns out this AMD designed GPU got rid of the nasty sepia tint. This video card creates a simple un-tinted OS that is a pleasure to use. The card is not BIG and uses only the power supplied by the GPU slot.\n\nThe card has some energy saver garbage installed that turns the card off if you power down your monitor. I took a star off for the energy saver mess. There really are no other issues. This is a great card to use on a Linux\\Ubuntu system that is not used for hard core gaming."

Installing this card resolved the performance issues. I was pleased enough with that purchase that I bought one for my home computer to resolve some lag issues when playing 4K video on my old PC. This card resolved that issue, too. I don't know how this product benchmarks against the completion. I didn't do any testing like that. I simply had performance issues with applications that needed a graphics card performance boost. The price was right on this graphics card and I found that it worked fine to resolve those issues.\n\nThe only issue that I had was that the package came with no English instructions, no drivers and no software. I am an IT technician by trade, so I had little trouble finding the right drivers and software online. On one PC, Windows Update found the drivers, but I still had to download and install the correct version of the Radeon software. On the other PC I had to download both the drivers and software. So, this wasn't much of a problem for me, but it may be more than a novice PC users can deal with.\n\nThis product did what I needed and I've had no problems with it either at home or at work. It gets a 5 star rating from me even though I would have expected better instructions for installing the product and obtaining the correct drivers & software."

Wer VR m\u00f6chte MUSS mehr investieren !\n\nDennoch m\u00f6chte ich diese Grafikkarte einmal f\u00fcr ihre erstaunliche und herausragende Leistung loben.\nHier hat MAXSUN alles richtig gemacht!\n\nIch habe einen Rechner mit ordentlich Leistung und nat\u00fcrlich auch mit einer entsprechenden Grafikkarte um damit die Valve Index VR-Brille zu betreiben. Ich bekam ein ausrangiertes Fujitsu Esprimo C710 mit USB3.0 und einem betagten aber ausreichenden Prozessor und suchte nun nach einer Low Profile Grafikkarte, die dabei auch noch schlank und bestm\u00f6gliche Leistung bringen sollte.\n\nMein verr\u00fcckter Plan:\nWenn an meinem Rechner was abraucht, sollte der kleine Esprimo das Ganze \u00fcberbr\u00fccken.\nMit 32GB RAM und der MAXSUN Radeon RX 550 ist mir das sehr gut gelungen.\nWir reden hier nat\u00fcrlich von minimalistischen Grafikeinstellungen ABER BeatSaber, Phasmophobia (SinglePlayer), Pistol Whip und Blade & Sorcery sind durchaus spielbar und die Karte wird dabei nicht \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig hei\u00df. Half Life - Alyx hingegen lagt sehr deutlich (wie es auch zu erwarten ist)\n\nDies ist keine Kaufempfehlung f\u00fcr VR, es soll aber verdeutlichen, was die kleine Karte auf dem Kasten hat.\nDenn hier schl\u00e4gt sie die vergleichbare GT 1030 um l\u00e4ngen. F\u00fcr Titel wie Diablo III und Co ifinde ich die RX 550 v\u00f6llig in Ordnung und sie macht dort auch eine echt gute Figur.\n\nFazit: Es gibt nat\u00fcrlich deutlich st\u00e4rkere Grafikkarten, egal ob AMD oder NVIDIA aber wer bei dem aktuellen Auf und Ab der Grafikkartenpreise eine g\u00fcnstige und verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig starke Grafikkarte sucht, weil er sich gerade keine gro\u00dfe leisten kann oder wie bei mir f\u00fcr einen kleineren Zweitrechner, sollte hier gut bedient sein."

The Quadro GPUs are the same as the Geforce GPUs, but certain features pertinent to cad, video editing, rendering, mostly using OpenGL, are enabled by (accessed by) the Quadro driver. This card has more CUDA cores, but less memory bandwidth and lower speed than the Geforce GTX-980.\n\nGeforce cards are gaming cards, where they excel. That is the only application in which they excel. Otherwise, Quadro blows Geforce away. I control this card with nvidia-settings, a Linux program written by nVidia. I only use Linux, so my experience does not apply to Windows.\n\nIf you really want to push this card, you should remove the cover using a tiny torx driver, and redo the thermal-interfaces with AS-5. THEN IT WILL REALLY SMOKE! Not literally. The K4200 is a lot of card for the money. To give an idea of it's rank, I get about 3200 on Unigine Heaven benchmark.\n\nThe fastest nVidia GPUs for gaming rack up around 10,000. Anyone can download Unigine Heaven and run it on their PC. THEN you have a starting point to work from. The Unigine site has a list of many video cards and their scores running Heaven; mostly Geforce cards, but a few Quadro.\n\nBut it's a rock solid choice, even for gaming. The Quadro line was always more stable than Geforce, had greater computing power, and features not available in Geforce models"

I bought two of these headless plugs (DisplayPort), plugged them into the i9, and there we go, I can now remote into my new machine from my old one (with twin monitors, too!). The plugs let you set any screen resolution you want up to their max supported resolution, I set both of them to 1920x1200 to match my existing monitors.

You will get some FPS of like 40-60 on super high demanding games that have Ray tracing on 1440p but you will be too busy crying at the amazing quality of all of those games to notice.

Seit Jahren wissen wir, dass diese Gamer-Grafikkarten f\u00fcr derartige Anforderungen bestens geeignet sind und die notwendige sehr hohe Aufl\u00f6sung, Schnelligkeit, Leistungsf\u00e4higkeit und Robustheit mitbringen. Nat\u00fcrlich werden sie auch f\u00fcr das Gaming eingesetzt und liefert dort perfekt ihre Leistung ab. Die Vielseitigkeit ist auf jeden Fall sehr eindrucksvoll.\n\nDie Grafikarte ist sehr gut verarbeitet und alle Anschl\u00fcsse sind sehr pr\u00e4zise und sauber gefertigt. Sie passt perfekt. Notwendig sind ein Platzbedarf von 2,5 Slots, sowie ein ausreichender Abstand zum n\u00e4chsten belegten Slot, um die Luftzufuhr sicher zu stellen. Sollte ein Netzteil am Boden des Towers angebracht sein, so ist darauf zu achten, dass sich die Ventilatoren der Grafikkarte und die des Netzteils nicht gegenseitig die Luft entziehen. Dass kann zu erheblichen K\u00fchlproblemen f\u00fchren. Abhilfe w\u00fcrde eine Wasserk\u00fchlung der Grafikkarte bringen. Die Grafikkarte hat aber noch eine zus\u00e4tzliche Raffinesse, an der schmalen Seite hinten, besitzt sie zwei Anschl\u00fcsse f\u00fcr zus\u00e4tzliche L\u00fcfter. Man kann also die bestehenden L\u00fcfter steuern, man kann aber auch zus\u00e4tzliche L\u00fcfter anschlie\u00dfen, so wie wir es getan haben. Das ist perfekt und innovativ gel\u00f6st!\n\nIm Betrieb ist sie durch die drei L\u00fcfter sehr leise. Die L\u00fcfter laufen erst an, wenn gro\u00dfe, hochaufgel\u00f6ste Bilder bearbeitet werden oder wenn im Gaming-Bereich richtig Last durch Einstellungen im hohen Aufl\u00f6sungsbereich von Details stattfinden. Bisher konnten alle Anwendungen und Spiele in der maximalen Aufl\u00f6sung betrieben werden. Die Treiber werden auf einer CD mitgeliefert, sodass einem Start nach der Installation nichts im Wege steht. Das Betriebssystem ist bei uns das Windows 10 Enterprise. Die Anschl\u00fcsse f\u00fcr Monitore sind soweit ausreichend.

Grafikkarte frei eingesetzt ohne dass sie von anderen Karten eingeengt wird und frei \u201eatmen\u201c kann. Betriebssystem Windows 10 Pro Creators Update.\n\nIch habe die Grafikkarte zum Austausch einer normalen ASUS GTX 1080-8G Gaming bezogen. Ich habe mir durch den Leistungszuwachs der TI einiges an Leistungszuwachs im Betrieb mit der HTC Vive VR-Brille versprochen.\n\nGetestet habe ich ausschlie\u00dflich im vollen OC-Modus ohne zus\u00e4tzliche manuelle \u00dcbertaktung. Als Programm wurde Asus GPU Tweak II genutzt, dass sich in der derzeitigen Version 1.4.5.4 mit Stand 20.04.17 als ziemlich bockig darstellt. Ich habe das Programm mit mehreren Nvidia Grafikkarten getestet und es macht \u00fcberall Sperenzchen. Abspeichern von Vorgaben nicht zuverl\u00e4ssig, Startverhalten nicht wie eingestellt. Hier ist -mal wieder- Nachholbedarf seitens Asus f\u00e4llig.\n\nDie Graka belegt 2,5 Slots (tats\u00e4chlich 3 Slots, was will man im halben noch einsetzen?). Sie ist schwer und h\u00e4ngt am Ende bei horizontaler Befestigung etwas durch. Eine Zotac Amp Extreme ist allerdings erheblich schwerer. Dennoch habe ich sie aus Sicherheitsgr\u00fcnden weiter befestigt, um den H\u00e4ngen entgegenzuwirken.\n\nIm Betrieb ist die Graka sehr leise und auch unter Vollast empfinde ich die Ger\u00e4uschentwicklung nicht als st\u00f6rend.\n\nDaher jetzt ohne lange Vorrede: Die Leistung ist brachial. Project Cars mit 4k@60 Hz mit allen Einstellungen auf Anschlag in ULTRA l\u00e4uft absolut fl\u00fcssig ohne einen einzigen Ruckler. Selbst bei den Replays ruckelt oder zuckt nichts. Dirt Rally ebenfalls alles auf Anschlag, 8* MSAA, Vsync aus bei 3840 * 2160 Aufl\u00f6sung ergibt bei meinem System im Benchmark die Werte:\n\nMin. 63 Frames/Sek und max. 91 Frames/Sek. Die Grafikkarte erreicht dabei keine Temperatur \u00fcber 70 Grad.\n\nBeim Betrieb mit der HTC Vive kann sie ebenfalls punkten. Mit erweitertem Supersampling in Steam VR kann ich eine deutliche Verbesserung der Darstellung feststellen. Project Cars kommt jetzt auf ein Supersampling von 2,2 bei fl\u00fcssigem Gameplay (vorher mit erheblicher manueller \u00dcbertaktung der GTX 1080 nur 1,5). Raceroom Experience kann ich auf volle 3.0 (mehr ist bei Raceroom nicht einstellbar) ohne Ruckler fahren. Assetto Corsa l\u00e4uft mit einem Supersampling von 2,5 noch vollkommen fl\u00fcssig.\n\nIn allen F\u00e4llen ist die Grafik in der Vive damit um einiges besser.\n\nEs bleibt daher festzustellen. Die Aufr\u00fcstung von einer ASUS GTX 1080-8G-Gaming auf die ASUS GTX 1080 O11G TI hat sich f\u00fcr mich auf alle F\u00e4lle gelohnt, wenngleich der Preis ziemlich hoch ist.\n\nUpdate 15.05.2017: Mit dem Tool Asus GPU Tweak II gebe ich auf. Unter Windows 10 Creators Update ist es nicht einsetzbar. Es wurde mit DREI unterschiedlichen PCs eingesetzt und f\u00fchrt u.a. zur sp\u00fcrbaren Verlangsamung ALLER Rechnersysteme!! Auch mit einer Asus GTX 1080 8G-Gaming, GTX 1070.\n\nL\u00f6sung, um die Graka in den von Asus zul\u00e4ssigen Werks-OC-Modus zu bekommen: GPU Tweak II einmal installieren und die Taktwerte alle notieren. Deinstallieren und MSI-Afterburner installieren. Die vorher ermittelten GPU Tweak Profilwerte (Silent, Gaming, OC) in Afterburner-Profilen hinterlegen."

Hab mich ein wenig eingelesen und gerade was die Grafikkarte angeht war schnell klar es soll eine NVIDIA werden da AMD nicht wirklich an die Leistung herankommt. Ich wollte auch definitiv das Flaggschiff haben und so war klar ein muss eine GTX1080TI werden. Weitere Recherchen brachten mich auf die Strix Modelle von ASUS und hier auch auf die OC Modelle. Die scheinen solide und f\u00fcr TOP Performance ausgelegt zu sein.\n\nIch habe die Karte nun gut 4 Monate in Betrieb un kann nur sagen JA ein absolutes TOP teil. Ich spiele Destiny 2 und PUBG in 4K und schaffe damit solide Frameraten \u00fcber 60FPS... JA nach Einstellungen auch mal bis 80FPS...\n\nDie Karte ist TOP verarbeitet und sieht durch die Aura Lichteffekte auch super aus ein einem Geh\u00e4use mit durchsichtiger Wand.

MAn merkt schon einen unterschied. Ich spiele mit Headset deswegen ist mir Ger\u00e4uschentwicklung pers\u00f6nlich nicht so wichtig aber auch unter Volllast ist das aus meiner Sicht ertr\u00e4glich. Im Silent Mode st\u00f6rt die Karte eigentlich gar nicht.\n\nWas ich pers\u00f6nlich sehr cool finde sind die vielen Anschl\u00fcsse. Die Karte kommt mit 2 x HDMI, 2 x Displayport und einem DVI Port. Hier sollte jeder ohne gro\u00dfe M\u00fche seine Monitore angeschlossen bekommen. Wenn man ein VR Headset hat ist der HDMI Port Praktisch. Sind beides HDMI 2.0 Ports.\n\nWer die Karte im Budget hat dem kann ich die nur w\u00e4rmstens empfehlen...

                    "text": "Generally speaking, I'm not much of an overclocker. Sure, I'll tweak my settings a bit and get a few extra MHz here and there, but I'm not anywhere near the enthusiast this card is aimed at. That being said, I needed an upgrade to my aging, yet still formidable, GTX 680 and wanted something to 'future-proof' my system. I've had very good results from ASUS, with three quarters of my rig from that company, and haven't any reason to complain yet. I consider them to make quality and premium components, and this card has only reinforced that ideology. I purchased it wanting the highest quality, the most options and with an emphasis on gaming, while also bearing in mind cost per performance. To me, something like the Titan series hasn't breached that ratio yet, so after much research and probing on my end, I finally fell with the GTX 980.\n\nTo begin, just so a potential customer knows a little about me so as to weigh my opinion against others, I have been building computers for about ten years now. I am A+ and Network+ certified, and have worked the area of computers officially for the better part of three years. What started as a hobby is now my job. I surely don't know everything nor should I be considered an expert on the topic, I just happen to know a couple things and my way around a computer. I'm sure many others can say the same. Take that with as many grains of salt as you wish. On to the review.\n\nPHYSICAL DESIGN\nAesthetically speaking, this card takes the cake. The color scheme and design is of course user preference, but I for one find it absolutely fantastic. I have the Maximus Formula VII motherboard, also with the ROG scheme, so this matches my current setup perfectly. The backplate, while not providing any real thermal benefit, does give the card a bit rigidness and stability which the card does require because of its size. The fans are of decent size and are quite noiseless, even under load (so far to date). The load bearing LED is helpful though its accuracy is debatable; I suspect software patches will increase its effectiveness over time, so I can't fault the card just yet as it is relatively new. But it's still a nice touch. The power LEDs are very helpful and let you know if the card is receiving power; upon insertion into the slot, they will glow red indicating that the card is seated but power has not yet been applied. Once proper power is given, the LEDs turn solid white. I'm sure this will be helpful when diagnosing future problems when trying to rule out power-related issues.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nAs stated earlier, I'm not a heavy overclocker as of yet. I have however been able to achieve stable clock speeds exceeding 1400MHz on the GPU, and 7060MHz on the memory side of things. Not jaw dropping mind you, but very reasonable considering I am only on air-cooling at the moment. Temperatures have also been quite good, with the card barely topping out in the high sixties (Celsius) during heavy gaming. At idle it sits very comfortably at twenty seven degrees. The reference cooler, if my memory serves correctly, allows for around eighty degrees under load - quite a big difference considering I haven't modified my cooling components. I think this speaks to ASUS and their design implantation. But that is one man's opinion.\n\nSOFTWARE\nI consider the software straight forward and simple, something others may or may not appreciate. With the click of the mouse one can modify clock speeds of just about anything as well as fan speeds. By default access is given for the boost clock, memory clock and fan speed but there are a host of other options available. And most tweaking can be done without touching the voltage. But if one wishes the voltage can be unlocked and cranked up, so seasoned overclockers aren't hindered by the over-simplified approach of GPU Tweak. The monitoring extension of GPU Tweak is very good, as it tracks anything and everything about your card. If you haven't been blessed with a second monitor where you can watch temps in real time as you game, the program tracks maximum and minimum values, so upon exiting a game for example, you can see what temp your card topped out at. Same goes for clock speeds and fan RPMs.\n\nOVERALL IMPRESSION\nI love this card. This card has taken everything I've thrown at it without breaking a sweat. Longevity will of course be the ultimate decider, but for now I'm very satisfied. Expensive? Yes, there's no denying that. And there's nothing wrong with other cards from EVGA or GIGABYTE or whatever. I just happen to like ASUS and don't mind paying a little more. Choice is yours. I'd recommend if you are a gamer and plan on doing some hardcore-like things in the future (liquid cooling/nitrogen), but there is nothing wrong with keeping it on air, at least in my eyes. I'd also recommend obtaining drivers from Nvidia and utilizing their GeForce Experience program - might be all just marketing, but the program will help keep your drivers up to date. Video-game specific drivers have also been released, most notably Advanced Warfare and GTA V, so that is helpful in keeping on track. My rig is posted below as are some of the games that I play, so as to help you gauge if my findings are even relevant to your situation.

                    "text": "Using MSI Afterburner, I did some quick overclocking. The voltage slider doesn't really affect voltage. I am not sure what's going on there. nevertheless, here are the results. (So there are results without applying any additional voltage from MSI Afterburner.)\n\nCore clock: +200MHz\nMemory clock: +400MHz\nFinal frequency during gaming and benchmark\ncore: 1516MHz\nmemory: 7806MHz\n\nThat's both of the cards stable in SLI. These OC results are actually higher than online reviews with voltage applied for this specific card. Maybe I finally get lucky, but two cards in a row? Gotta give ASUS some credit.\n\n3DMark Fire Strike\nUltra: 6680\nExtreme: 11676\n\nMy scores are bottlenecked by my 4.3GHz 4770K. However, the Ultra score is still ranked 38th world-wide on 3dmark Hall of Fame's 2x card leaderboard. So you know these cards are one of the best. Adding in one more, you will be in top 100 world wide no doubt.\n\nSome stats collected during stress test, with auto fan profile.\nRoom temperature: 24-25C\n\nGPU1 (on top, one DVI connected):\nASIC quality: 78.7%\nVDDC on OC: 1.175V\nPeak temp: 77C (75-76C stable)\nPeak fanspeed: 63%, 2150RPM\n\nGPU2 (on bottom, one DVI and one HDMI connected):\nASIC quality: 72.9%\nVDDC on OC: 1.212V\nPeak temp: 71C (70-71C stable)\nPeak fanspeed: 53%, 1500RPM\n\nIf you ask why the better card is hotter, it's because it's sitting on top. The nvidia/pcgamer folks are not lying. The thermal is a huge factor. So make sure you put your best card on top to counter the additional heat from the bottom card. Also connect as many displays to bottom card and assign PhysX to bottom card. Unfortunately I don't have DP displays or adapters to move all displays to bottom card.\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/sli-overclocking-guide-nvidias-tom-petersen-on-maximizing-multi-gpu-performance/\n\nThe HW fan profile apparently takes temperature and card itself into account when scaling the fan speed. So at same fan speed percentage, the fan speed is different between the cards. It also reacts to temperate a bit differently. The cooling solution is absolutely fantastic. This is actually the first time I am confident enough that HW fan profile won't cripple my OC results.\n\nBoth of them are not noisy under load. The fan only gets audible at 1500RPM, and obvious at 2000RPM. However, here obvious I don't mean noisy. The nosiest level I've ever experienced on these two cards is still quieter than official GTX780's fan during same load.\n\nAlso as advertised, the fan indeed completely stops in 2D workloads, even with 5760x1080 resolution. The temperate stays at 60C (after idling for 3min after benchmark).\n\nPros:\n1) One of the best air cooled cards. I am totally sold on DirectCU II solution now\n2) Very quiet, and stays cool even overclocked\n3) Backplate is welcome\nCons:\n1) Longer and wider than other GTX980s. Make sure you are not too constrained by space.\n2) PCI-E mounting bracket is a bit too wide (by 0.5mm), which forces me to remove adjacent mounting brackets to make room for it on my CM Stryker case.\n\nPro or Con depends on personal preference:\n1) White LEDs on power connectors can't be turned off. As long as MB has power, it will light up. Thus if you hate any light at night, that's a con. It's not too bright though, but very convenient to assure yourself the power connectors are intact.\n2) No other lights on card.\n3) Fan stops at idle, with GPUs at 60C. This is definitely safe, but indeed contributes to ambient temperature inside case. If you are the ones that would rather spin the fan a little to make it cooler, you can design your own curve in MSI Afterburner.\n\nThat's my results for now, I will run with +150/+300MHz OC for daily usage and gaming. If it breaks I will of course update, but I haven't had any GPUs failing for all the years though. That's probably because I never cheap out on power, mb or even power stripes...\n\nI also want to thank Amazon: I discontinued my Prime membership last year, but after this order got stuck in prepare for shipping for 5 days, I started a support ticket. They changed it to 1-day shipping for free and also price matched newegg ($569.99). Then they gave me a further discount in form of refund because \"Pick Your Path\" promotion is not included here, but included on newegg for same SKU. These all happens within 2 days by several emails."

I was seeing benchmarks and reviews and already saw how even just one of these cards was 1.5x faster than both of mine, so to add a second one was icing on the cake. But the frames, while a big part of why I am so happy, were not the only part, not by a long shot.\n\n1. Geforce experience and the control panel were so easy to install and keep updated. I have owned AMD/ATI for about 7 years and it was never as easy as that was. I can now look at the drivers, optimize games with a button, shadowplay and the best part for me is updating the drivers. Crazy. Everything was in tow. The drivers responded well to every game and I didn't have to fiddle with them like I did previously to get them to work correctly in games.\n\n2. I almost forgot I was playing with MY computer in the middle of crisis 3 game. It was so quiet. Like I really couldn't believe it. When the cards aren't doing anything they are off which is great but even in game the fans are so quiet compared to the reference 6970 cards that I always prepared for and could here even when It was stuffed away behind my desk. The case was open and right next to me and I bet I heard more noise from the CPU fan than I did the cards. Best part was the cards never went above 73c. Not even the sandwiched one.\n\n3. Everything plays on max. There is nothing these cards can't do. I play at 1080 with 120hz monitor and it just destroys like nothing before.\n\n4. The power consumption is so little compared to how powerful they are. They already come pre overclocked but you can go even more and not have to worry. This was a reason I didn't upgrade sooner to a 290x or 780ti cause my 850w could take them but with a smaller overclock than these could.\n\nIt's not that its without a few issues though. So let me break it down.\n\nPro:\n- Crazy fast\n- Super quiet\n- Super cool\n- Low wattage\n- Sexy design\n- Pre overclocked with room for more\n- Easy install and set up\n- Multiple ports for all kinds of set-UPS\n- Nice backplate to keep it cool and so you can hold it without worrying of breaking something\n\nCon:\n- Very big, be careful. It was much taller and longer but not thicker than my old cards. I couldn't get it fit with my HAF X case with the side fan tunnel. Once I took off the little tunnel thing, it was okay.\n- Blows hot air around case. The reference cards take the air and shoot it out the ass end but these cards although very cool, kind of make the case hotter.\n- SLI does not working for every game. As in the profiles have not been made. The game still runs great on one card just kind of a waste. But you can trick some games into using both cards by setting up a profile.\n- One that came looked like the cooler wasn't on as good as the other. It had more give. It works fine and is cool but just slightly worrying.\n\nI am 100% happy with my purchase. It was the best upgrade I could have done and I wouldn't have picked another supplier. Amazing cards"

Before there were random stutters and I could never place a finger on what caused that particular one. After the RoG I got went down to one card and it was flawless though I had to lower the resolution. I went back to 2 and the stutters returned. I was on the fence between a 970, 980 or waiting for a 980ti but finally caved on the Cyber monday discount. I wasn't expecting a huge framerate increase over the 670s, but with a mild overclock I got about 15-20% across the board and having a single GPU is prefect for me. Also with double the texture memory many games have opened up a new level of pretties I can turn on. I went from a GTX 480 to SLI 670s and really missed the overall stability of a single monster GPU, the 980 works great.\n\nNot that it bares much to the overall gaming experience but 3dmark firestrike went from 12021 with mildly OC'd 670s and a 2600K@4.8ghz to 14231 with a fairly heavily OC'd 980.\n\nThe only oddity that freaks me out is that the Strix 980 shuts off both fans at idle occasionally barely spinning up one fan while watching youtube vids and such but only 200-300 rpm, it tends to idle between 55-60\u00b0C but the instant you game both fans come up. Playing BF4@2560x1440 set to ultimate I get right about 60fps and the card hovers about 63-65\u00b0C with the fans around 40%, if I lower it to high I get about 135-145fps and the card hovers around 52\u00b0C with the fans at 30% which is funny that it runs cooler under load than at idle.\n\nOverall the Strix 980 is a great quiet card. If you want more bang for the buck a pair of 970s would be better, though with the recent price decrease an R9 295X destroys anything in price to performance and is about the same price as a pair of 970s. Since I didn't want to deal with multi GPU, the 980 is perfect for me."

The GM204 graphics processor, which powers the GTX 980 in this review, comes with amazing power consumption improvements that are the foundation behind the GeForce GTX 970 and GTX 980 taking the enthusiast market by storm.\n\nThe GeForce GTX 980 is carved out of the 28 nm GM204 silicon with all its shaders enabled, resulting in a shader count of 2,048. There are 128 available texture units and the ROP count is a massive 64, with a 256-bit bus connecting 4 GB of GDDDR5 memory.\n\nASUS decided to use their recently introduced STRIX brand for their GTX 980 flagship. The card is built on a customized PCB design with an improved cooler that completely stops the fans in idle and features higher clock frequencies out of the box.\n\nASUS has outdone themselves yet again. The GeForce GTX 980 STRIX OC is pretty much perfect, bringing significant improvements over the already excellent NVIDIA reference design. ASUS overclocked their card out of the box, which, depending on the resolution, yields a 5-7 % performance improvement. This lets it beat any single-GPU card on the market conclusively while also making it faster than the dual-GPU GTX 690 and roughly equal to the dual-GPU HD 7990. Just like the stock GTX 980, I'd recommend the ASUS GTX 980 STRIX for full detail gaming at 1440p and 1600p, with 4K being quite playable when two cards are teamed in SLI.

It's quiet even when the fans spin, and it's pushing smooth game play on everything I've thrown at it, on a 2k res monitor (ASUS PB278Q) and ultra graphics settings. I can get it to touch 70\u00baC, but no higher yet. Even at that point, the fans are spinning at 43% of max. Taking a peek at my HW monitor, it's sitting at a comfortable 32\u00baC with the fans off. Some people will report that their max and idle temps will be higher or lower, the variables being the ambient room temp and your case air flow or overall cooling solution. I like my case quite, so I sacrifice a bit of airflow.\n\nIt's kind of nice to have a card that can support more than 2 simultaneous monitors. I used to have to turn one off to throw a video over to my TV, but that's not necessary anymore :) It supports up to 4.\n\nI've been an EVGA fan boy for over a decade, but in light of their recent design mishaps and customer complaints with the 900 series cards, I decided to try ASUS as I've yet to buy a bad product from them. Regrets? None.\n\nThe only CONS that are worth mentioning are:\n1) This card is friggin huge: length and width. I was worried that it wouldn't fit my case with a side fan, but it does - just barely. The heat pipe looping away from the card toward the side of the case just about touches the side fan casing, but it doesn't get hot, so whatever.\n2) The overclocking software from ASUS is a little buggy. The monitor panel tends to lock up and requires a restart just about all the time, but I only really needed it to set the thing up."

                    "text": "PROS:\n-Quality: This card is heavy with an amazingly designed board and metal fan covers. The cooler keeps it under 64c even when benchmarking!\n-Frames: I am getting 299FPS in Street Fighter 4 Ultra, 100FPS in Tomb Raider, 200s in Diablo ROS and SC2. I would highly recommend this card for people using 120 or 144mhz monitors.\n-Noise: I use MSI Afterburner software to manually keep the fan on its lowest speed @ 35% then bump up while gaming. These fans are the quietest fans I've ever owned and are very efficient at cooling. I barely notice they are even on while gaming. I have a silent build in a micro ATX case.\n-Aesthetics: This is a custom PCB GTX980 with a gorgeous cooler.\n-Drivers: I am using 344.16 and haven't found any glitches yet. I never knew how unreliable my AMD card drivers were until now. I'll never go back at this point! AMD Fanboy converted.\n-Power: This cards uses an 8pin and 6pin PCIex connection on my 550watt power supply. nvidia recommends a 500w minimum on their site. I was worried about this but haven't run into any issues yet. I'm sure my electric bill will thank me for this upgrade later on.\n-Back Plate: This card isn't going to sag any time soon. I still supported it with a trash tie but it isn't needed.\n\nCONS:\n-Connections: There is only 1 DVI-D and 1 HDMI port on the back! Dispalyports are not even mainstream yet so you'll need top buy cables if you plan on using 3 monitors like myself. I knew this before I bought it but be warned.\n\nThoughts: I upgraded from an AMD 6870 which I held on to for a long time. I went from 23 frames to 200 frames in passmark8.0! This was the video card I was waiting for since I wanted something that ran cool, performed well and didn't take a 800w+ PSU to run like the 780ti. This is the quietest GTX980 out there and definitely the best looking. Some benchmarks show the gigabyte windforce card pumping out higher scores but it is factory clocked higher. This card runs way cooler and has a much higher overclocking headroom."

No one seems to have ideas other than that quite possibly the first card and the replacement were both from the same batch that could be defective. My guess is that although this may be a powerful beast of a graphics card... it apparently can't handle more than 2 monitors without loss of certain Windows capabilities and driver lag. I just decided to return the replacement for a refund and will look into seeing if SLI will work with lesser beef (and price) per card. $550+ for just one of these cards and it can't handle this simple need... ugh! Sad too because I'm not exactly that much of a gamer or major photo/video editor. I'm just a major multitasker with common programs like Excel, Quicken, WMP, and IE. Therefore I hate having to explore more complex PC needs just to drive 3 monitors that are above 1080p. I hope this review has been of some help to any who my situation pertains to.\n\nThe card I got in is apparently defective after contacting ASUS. I have 2x 27\" 2560x1440 monitors AND 1x 34\" Curved 3440x1440 monitor in a 3-monitor setup that ASUS said the card should drive them all without graphics issues. I do get a display on all three monitors at full resolutions but Areo gets disabled and when moving folders or other windowed programs around on my screen they all trail bad and then the redraws take a few moments. Sometimes the system has issues powering down when shutting down the PC. Even scrolling is affected in some programs. Graphics drivers are up to date and even updated the VGABIOS per ASUS request... still no help. Even tried dropping the resolutions down... no help. I've tried un-plugging one of the monitors and still no help. My rig is comprised of:\n\nASUS Crosshair V Formula-Z motherboard\nAMD FX-6350 Six-core 3.9GHz CPU\nGEIL 16GB (4x 4GB) DDR3-1600 RAM\nCorsair 750 TX PSU\nSamsung 840PRO SSD\nASUS SATA DVD+/-RW\nASUS PCI-X WiFi card\n\nASUS said my rig specs are fine for this card and that my three monitor setup shouldn't be a problem so therefore the card must be defective. Amazon has issued a replacement for me and once I've swapped out the cards I will update my review...."

But being an Senior IT Service Delivery Manager for years I can't stand by and let people buy something based on misleading information and poor if non-existent support. I purchased an X99 Deluxe MB, STRIX GTX 960 Graphics, ASUS Monitor, Router, and many other ASUS components because in the past I trusted ASUS quality and support and I wanted one seamless, integrated solution supported by a known quality manufacturer.\n\nSo I'm giving this 1 star because ASUS support is practically non-existent yet they will respond here with questions about (*please tell us the problem, we will support you, please e-mail us, we will open a case for your and solve your problem). Been there, done that, multiple times, over and over as you will see if you look at the thousands of people pleading for help on a product that simply does not work.\n\nWhy am I writing this really poor review? Take a look at the ASUS \"Forums\" and search on \"HomeCloud\". you will find hundreds of posts for help on that \"bundled and promised to work\" product, over 10,000 (you read that right \"Ten Thousand\") views and NOT ONE of the posts have a solution to why the \"ASUS HomeCloud\" produce fails over and over and over and over again. All these people are frustrated and upset that the bundled software for ASUS products simply don't work and ASUS is blowing them off for support. In fact, take a quick search on Google for ASUS HomeCloud. You'll be shocked and run as fast as you can to a different brand; i kinda wish I had but the saving grace is their hardware realy is pretty solid and perfoms very well.\n\nSo when I (and many many others) try to get support on the software ASUS promises out of the box (Home Cloud happens to be one of the explicit benefits of why I chose to go all out ASUS) I get nothing but a runaround (send us logs, send us email, re-install, reboot, etc. etc.).\n\nIf you want ASUS because you think you will get your own personal cloud storage.... don't, Go buy a different manufacturers product that will stand behind their product.\n\nSo FIX IT ASUS, then, after you've fixed it, tested it, proven it works (and by the way, that it works in the USA) go help the people pleading for help and frustrated on your and other IT forum sites about it."

At first I only had 1 desktop and two laptops. Oh and trust me, I even tried the laptops, I bought a e2mc to usb chord, (e2mc is the new smaller adaptors for solid state hard drives and wireless cards, and yes you can plug into that put your card on a riser) Basically I tried everything. On the first card, I bought from this company it didn't work. With anything! I feel like the day it came in was the day I woke up and stepped into the outer ring of hell.

Most cards that have an output layout like this are fake and, seeing reviews from people saying it won't run DX11, I'm inclined to believe this isn't even a 6770 as those did run DX11. The listed clock speed is about 200mhz lower than the original cards which, at best, points to these being faulty cards flashed with a different BIOS to operate at a lower clock speed. HD 5770s and 6770s (same card with 2 names) also NEVER came with 4GB of VRAM.\n\nAgain, this points to this being a card with a fake BIOS. I've tested another faked GPU claiming to be a GTX 960 4GB and the card even reported itself as such to the computer. In actuality it was a GT640 with 1GB of VRAM. When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash. In other words KEEP SHOPPING!"

While this card is a tad expensive it is not priced at the ridiculously insane prices of the middle to high end gaming video cards in 2022. This GPU has done the job of letting me go anywhere on the internet without video lag.\n\nI had a more expensive NVIDIA GPU in my system with otherwise state of the art hardware. The newest most power Ryzen 9 \\ 5900 CPU, fast memory and a 750 watt power supply. The NVIDIA GPU ran like hot garbage on my Ubuntu system. Ubuntu has a nasty sepia color scheme that saturates the entire OS and everything in it. It is not only ugly but painful to look at due to my vision issues.\n\nI did not know for sure at the time but, I hoped a new video card from someone other than NVIDIA might perform better. Turns out this AMD designed GPU got rid of the nasty sepia tint. This video card creates a simple un-tinted OS that is a pleasure to use. The card is not BIG and uses only the power supplied by the GPU slot.\n\nThe card has some energy saver garbage installed that turns the card off if you power down your monitor. I took a star off for the energy saver mess. There really are no other issues. This is a great card to use on a Linux\\Ubuntu system that is not used for hard core gaming."

This card resolved that issue, too. I don't know how this product benchmarks against the completion. I didn't do any testing like that. I simply had performance issues with applications that needed a graphics card performance boost. The price was right on this graphics card and I found that it worked fine to resolve those issues.\n\nThe only issue that I had was that the package came with no English instructions, no drivers and no software. I am an IT technician by trade, so I had little trouble finding the right drivers and software online. On one PC, Windows Update found the drivers, but I still had to download and install the correct version of the Radeon software. On the other PC I had to download both the drivers and software. So, this wasn't much of a problem for me, but it may be more than a novice PC users can deal with.\n\nThis product did what I needed and I've had no problems with it either at home or at work.

[Except the 4-5 port USB 3.0 PCI-Express card I have in it (it's the bright color of red I would live to see if a 69 Camaro SS or Fender Stratocaster)]. So it's slated to be painted or Colored on top...after I look into whether that could fry it or not. ANYWAY... Not only does it look very nice/awesome. It can definitely ease much of the strain that is placed more and more on your PCI-E x16 or x8 slots these days (My card is an EVGA Geforce GTX 1080 SSC ITX. The thing weighs three pounds. Don't open another tab to fact check that. It says so in the specs, it's an impressive beast of a card.\n\nThe outer side of this brace has a nice matte-type texture, but TAKE NOTE: If your graphics card is 2.5 slots thick, the instructions state that you will need to use it with the brace flipped over, [lonely screw point down. If this is the case for you, the side that will be facing out is smooth with a glassy shine. (nothing a little, light circular scraping with a nail file won't fix I imagine, but just a heads up)]. The manufacturer name is also not present on the inner side, which us unfortunate imho, because the name seams to suit such an accessory in such an intended location very nicely and even contribute to the cool factor :).\n\nA couple other things you should know. 1. If you're like me and you have a bunch of punched out expansion slots on your case. Make sure the ones that are not occupied are closed with some nice slot covers/blanks. It says so in the instructions for good reason tightening all the screws on an uneven surface can make things pretty off center, including the stress placed on the screw holes of an unoccupied slot.\n\n2. You only get four bumper pads. The adhesive is amazing, very strong, but take your sweetest of time planning exactly where they are going to go. I mean it. Put the brace on screws and all and see if you need to do a little bending of the metal between the slot opening to make sure the screws will be perpendicular to the back plate ahead of time, because a couple degrees looks pretty big by the time your eyes reach the other end of the brace, and the adhesive isn't meant to have the bumper pads be repeatedly removed and reapplied. Because you didn't scope things out ahead of time (Learn from my mistake :) ).\n\nAnother plus is the brace can help obscure the view of less flattering cards. just don't put them on the middle hole if they will impede air flow to the GPU and you love your graphics card.\n\nJust take your time with a ruler and make a couple little pit marks with a knife point or something, and mark the places you want the bumpers after having seen where they will fit with the brace in the ideal position (use the screws when checking this! don't \"eye ball\" this.\n\nIn short. I love it. I would have given 4.5 stars, but sadly this is not yet an option.\n\nThe only thing they could do better would be to include more bumper pads for if /WHEN you miss a detail.\n\nIf you are like me and sometimes read more reviews after buying, don't panic, 4th Level Manufacturing will send you more bumpers at no charge if you need more!\n\nI wonder if they come in different colors??? :)"

Turns out that the backplate of the card keeps it pretty rigid, but it's a good peace of mind to know that the bulky thing is being held up at the end of it. I also picked this brace over the countless other designs out there because it looks cool as a sort of truss design (it is a kind of plastic material, but is sound enough to do the job).\n\nMy one issue was this with my case and this card, I couldn't put the brace between the case and the card. There was about 1/4 or so of an inch too much material to put it in as shown in the product images. I easily remedied this by just flipping the brace upside down, and using two of the sticker bumps that are provided. It needs three screw holes from the video card panels on the back panel of your case, so instead of doing the bottom GPU screw and the two below it, I just used the three screws below the GPU. Easy solution. Just know that the \"front\" of the brace is a sort of matte black, whereas the \"back\" is a little more plastic-like. The front is also where the small Atlas logo is printed.\n\nThe manufacturer sent an email when I purchased the product saying that they'd be very willing to send extra copies of anything provided (the sticker bumps and screws) for free. I liked that, but the materials originally provided have so far sufficed.\n\nOverall pretty happy, even if it's such a simple object that ended up being redundant anyway.\n\nEdit:\nBought another one for my brother's card. His showed up as a sort of painted piece of hardwood, rather than plastic. His bumps were also different than mine. I had clear bumps and two were flat topped, the other two rounded. All four of my brother's were these semi-skini cylindrical black rubber bumps. Not really a complaint, but just know that there seems to be more than one kind that you can get here."

Couple of points:\n\n- The bump dots' adhesive doesn't stay on the bump dots very well when taking them off the sheet, so you have to be pretty careful or the adhesive will be ruined. That being said, there were five or six bump dots included.\n\n- It is made out of plastic. Not a big deal as it is pretty thick and sturdy and now looking through other reviews, I see that mentioned. I would have liked it mentioned in the product description. A bit of a high price for plastic.\n\n- It would have been better if, as others have mentioned, it came with some offsets. While the bump dots to make it so it doesn't come in contact with the fans, having out further on the edge of the card would keep it entirely away from the fans and supported better. Just another thing that I need to buy and for the overall price of the product should have been included.\n\nOverall, it worked well and I would recommend it. If you do have the H440 and two cards, this will not work for any card unless it is in the top slot.

I will however say that this thing has done a great job so far of supporting my GPU. There is a specific order of steps I've found to achieve optimal support which I will explain briefly.\n\nI found that by placing the rubber risers along the length of the brace, and loosely installing the brace onto the pcie slots, you can apply upwards pressure onto the card and brace without causing flex. Once you've achieved a flat plane, and you're satisfied with it's position, you need to tighten the top and bottom screws as tight as you can, then the middle. They have to be very tight, and you will need the washers or else I would imagine you will crack the brace as it seems to made of a hard plastic. I followed these steps, and took my time to perfect it and I've achieved a perfectly straight plane, while looking great. Keep in mind I have a huge and heavy FTW GTX1080 Hybrid watercooled card, and this things still manages to support her.\n\nInstall it however you find suitable, just take your time and remember it's plastic.

It makes the GPU level, finally! My last case did this without any work put into it. At first impressions this does get some stars. Good, well built piece of plastic that is reinforced, and does hold up the GPU. Just not aesthetically pleasing. Sags worse than the video card after install. Did come with black screws and washers, which was a plus in my book. Installing into a Fractile Design Define R5 White Edition with window. Everything matched great. Had some trial and error with my MSi GTX 970 100ME. Though the final install did work without messing with the fans. The Rubber stand-offs were hard to place, PCI slot covers, which I was not willing to part with, were hard to place when in the upright position. Ended up having to defy the instructions and place the case on the side just to start to screw down the plate. After install looks awkward in the case itself. Will be adjusting and will hopefully update when I do. Sorry, I work 7 days a week and have no time to do this awesome stuff anymore like I used to."

Even though my MSI board has steel reinforced PCI slots, I was uncomfortable with how much my MSI GTX 1070 Gaming X sagged from the weight of the card. I did look at other adapters and options, and the Atlas Brace was the most attractive to me. Before I ordered I was concerned about needing spacers or other hardware like some have said, but no additional hardware was needed for my case - NZXT S340 Elite. It came in a simple box with instructions, 4 adhesive bumpers, 3 screws, and 3 washers. At first I thought it was pretty silly to ad the detailed instructions, but it ended up being very helpful. The installation of the Atlas brace went easy after I figured out where I going to place the rubber bumpers. I did double up the bumpers in the center of the graphics card while placing the others on the plastic area just outside the fan on the right. The fans spin without interruption and now my MSI 1070 is level without all that weight on the slot of my motherboard. The plate on the back of the NZXT case that helps hold the PCI slot covers in place now doesn't close all the way the way it did before. It leaves a space the width of the Atlas Brace, but it's fine. The plate still goes on and covers most of what it should. I do like the matte look of the brace. It doesn't take away or distract from my graphics card. You notice it, but you don't see it first. Overall great product."

After a while it started to sag slightly and then caused one of my fans to slightly tick at high RPMs. I noticed if I held up the card slightly it would stop ticking. I set out to find a GPU brace that I knew I could trust and also looked great in my build.\nThis brace is perfect.\n\nI want it to be known that this brace once purchased was followed up by a HAND TYPED email directly thanking me for buying the product and giving me contacts of which I could use if I had any problems or needed extra pieces for my card, free of charge.\n\nThe only thing (and I mean that really) ONLY THING that I could even say slightly caused a problem wasn't even caused by the company, it was caused by me. So on the edge of the L-shaped part of the bracket (the part where you screw the brace into the PCI bracket spots) there are 3 little humps that are there I believe purely for design. One of them was hitting a rivet used to hold a piece of my case together, so I had to use a flap disc on an angle grinder and flatten it out to get it to fit in my case. (I included a picture of this so its easier to understand)\n\nEverything about this brace I love.\nIt works perfectly and I would highly recommend it to anyone needing a similar product."

They arrived exactly as described and have taken all of the sag out of each graphics card, one of which had a very noticeable sag! An added bonus is that they look awesome - both of my computers have side windows so the look was a concern.\n\nSome of the reviewers have been negative regarding the strength of these braces allegedly causing them to crack or fracture during installation. After installing these braces into two computers, I can attest to the fact that they are neither brittle nor weak. My only guess is that those reviewers must have either mishandled the product or used a high torque drill to install them. A simple phillips head screwdriver and four minutes of your time is all it takes. I do recommend installing with the computer resting on it's side in order to facilitate the proper placement of the rubber stays to clear the GPU fans.\n\nMy last thought is regarding the price. A lot of reviewers have complained that you are only getting a piece of plastic with some screws and washers for almost $20. In my opinion, the functionality of this item makes it worth every penny. They do exactly what you need to protect your GPU card, which cost hundreds of dollars in my case, and they do it while looking great in the process. To my way of thinking - that's priceless!"

Super light weight and unobtrusive which is exactly what I wanted for my build. The only problem I have is it doesnt work for my GPU, unfortunately. I would have to modify it to use it. I have an EVGA RTX 2070 XC Ultra which means an abnormally large cooling radiator (really thick). The extra thickness places the screw holes for the case directly underneath the dividers between the factory cut screw slots in the brace. I knocked off 1 star because its not a universal brace but, the EVGA 2070 Ultra is a relitively new card.\nI would have done a half star if it would let me because it really is a well crafted piece. Overall, super happy with it and will probably hold onto it for another build someday. Until then, I'll have to find an alternative because this card is surprisingly heavy."

I know others will tell you to hop onto the 2060 and use a Molex 6 pin to 8 pin connector for ray-tracing and various other things or a 1660 TI(which is not much of an upgrade). But i would tell you to get this instead as it is 150$ cheaper and if you are looking into a solid budget to not spend a lot this would be it as it does work with VR without much issues. Also looking at other reviews i had no issues upgrading my graphics card and no issues at all with the drivers. Nvidia Geforce program recognized my Asus and immediately installed the proper drivers needed once i took my old Graphics card out, put in the new one and booted up my PC. The only small star knockoff was the slight measurement that ASUS had for the GPU it ended up being correct on the vertical and the length, but not the horizontal it was only a tiny bit fatter on the sides. Still fit my PC but it was almost a slight close call nothing huge though. Also i would recommend this to anyone upgrading from the 900-700 series but would like something more on the budget side for a few years before going for higher end or those looking to go for something that will last a long time and be energy efficient. This would do really well."

My need was for a machine that would happily work Davinci Resolve movie editing. This GPU works just fine for that, but to do so I had to add an external power supply and ditch the on-board PSU for the Dell. There are NO spare power taps on the 3670 - no supplementary power for cards or additional drives. The ATX mobo connection is also special.\n\nI used a Corsair CX Series Modular Power Supply PLUS a 24-pin to 8-Pin adapter to power the mobo, that also gave the power to the GPU, and power to a second drive so I could switch to an SSD plus the original HDD as a data store.\n\nThe new PSU sits on top of the case - not to everyone's taste - but it all works very happily and is almost silent."

If you haven't received a code from Amazon via email, contact support and they will sort you out ASAP.

Most modern games, including GTA V, The Witcher III, Dishonored 2, Destiny 2, PUBG, and many other AAA games utilize about 3-4 Gb of VRAM, so this graphics card is perfect for handling modern titles at 60fps on high-ultra settings. If you are looking for future proofing, you may want to grab the 6gb version of the card, however, if you plan on upgrading in a year or two, this will get you through a few seasons before going for an Nvidia 20-series GPU."

The review for a similar one said that one was about 4 or 5mm too short, so I finally found this one with no real reviews. This one fits perfectly and is the right height for my 1U chassis. If yours is similar this should work well.\nWhen the 90 degree adapter is plugged into the pci slot, the top of the adapter is 1in above the top of the PCI slot it is plugged into. This leaves about 1/4\" from the top of the adapter to the top cover of the case.\nI took some pictures of my case when fitting with a 10G NIC, that should give you an idea of the clearances.

I had purchased this before I saw the answer to my question about why this card was cheaper than expected. And it's because it's a Radeon 550, NOT a Radeon RX 500 or a Radeon 550X and certainly not a Radeon RX 550X.\n\nI think that AMD bears some of the blame in how they are naming the variants. The RX and the non-RX differ in the memory bus width. The RX being 128 and the non-RX being 64. But the seller is definitely misleading by stating that this is an RX 550, though they do call out 64 bit in the name.\n\nI think that the price I paid was commensurate to it being a Radeon 550, and it being a one slot, lower power product is actually a plus. It has enough power for what I do and it supports HDR10. So the only issue I have is with the product name being misleading.\n\n------------------------------------------\nInitial review below:\nWhen I first ordered this, I was very suspicious of the price. It was $20-$30 lower than all the other 2GB RX 550 cards. And the delivery date was going to be weeks after the order. I ended up getting it much sooner than expected, and it looks future deliveries will be much quicker. So maybe an inventory issue.\n\nOnce I received the card, I looked for any signs that this was fake or some other even cheaper card made to look like the RX 550. The card seems real. It's installed and working without a problem. The only quibble is the instructions. It's generic. It talks about having to connect the card to a power supply. That's not true. Just plug it and it'll get sufficient power from the bus.\n\nDon't expect to play the latest games at 4K with this card. It's a budget graphics card, enough to play some older games without any issues (Skyrim, for example). For this price, it's excellent."

It was purchased to provide dual monitor support to a client and it works perfectly. Don't think it will do very well for graphics intensive games but the casual gamer might be ok here.\n\nThings to note:\nthe shroud of this card pushes it into the next slot so i would class it as being 1.5 slots tall. Be mindful of this if you plan to use the expansion just below the PCIex16 slot\nThe fan stays off when the GPU isn't stressed and only comes on when it heats up\nThe package is very minimal and only contains the Card and a Drivers Disc.
