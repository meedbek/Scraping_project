                    "text": "OK, it arrived on time, but that is sort of an issue. When I purchased this product, Amazon guaranteed delivery on Sunday Feb. 6, 2022. On the 6th, I woke up to an email that it would be delayed until Monday the 7th. No problem, we had a blizzard and people have been digging out. BUT, it was delivered on Sunday and just left outside, in the freezing cold and snow, without me knowing or expecting it was going to happen. Luckily, a friend stopped in for five minutes, and by coincidence that's when the package was left in the cold and snow, so it wasn't there when he came up the porch, but it was there when he went down and my package got to me safely. The seller bears no responsibility for this, as it was fulfilled by Amazon, but for some reason, Amazon doesn't let us write reviews for the customer service, so here it is. You can do better, Amazon.\n\nAs for the product itself, it's not really as bad as my \"stars\" would suggest. It arrived in what appears to be brand new packaging. I can't find any evidence that the anti-static bag was ever opened before. I installed it in my aging Dell Inspiron 3700 (with an i5-8400, and 12GB of RAM) hooked it all up, turned it on, and after about 5 minutes of some installation process (at which time there WAS video) my screen automatically reverted to the display settings it had prior to the install, and it works just fine. I installed Nvidia GeForce and, after one more driver update it was over. The entire process was from start to finish was less than 20 minutes.\n\nThis was the first time I have ever installed a GPU, and I can only assume that that is EXACTLY how it is supposed to work. As for the value for money, NO GPU has a good value to money ratio. Crypto-miners and the pandemic have seen to that.\n\nAs for gaming, this just is NOT a card built to plays today's most advanced games. I got this card because PGA 2K21 can only track one profile at a time, so two people with two profiles need two copies of the game to track their stats in co-op. Now, my aging Dell could manage about 25 FPS in \"potato mode,\" a number that made it unplayable. With this card, on low settings (one step up from potato mode), this card and the i5 deliver 90FPS steadily at 1080p quality.\n\nThe problem there, is that 2K21 is really \"The Golf Club 3\" with 2K's marketing slapped on the box. As such, the entire install from Steam was just 6.6GB. And as every modern gamer knows, the 5-15GB game file size was lost to any game above the 'indie\" classification when the games went 4K. Which means that the game would have to still be in potato mode if 4K textures even existed in the files for processing.\n\nThe only other \"modern\" game I have on the Dell is Kerbal Space Program. And that, with low settings turned on, and the FPS locked to 80, this card and the i5 can get maintain a steady 60 in the assembly buildings and launchpad, and dropped into the 40 FPS range during the launches I tested. But that is normal. KSP can make even monster PC's cry for mercy if the user launches a big enough ship. The limitation there is far more CPU dependent than GPU dependent as the game tries to simulate physics, heat, and gravity calculations on hundreds of individual parts simultaneously.\n\nAs for video streaming, honestly, I don't see very much improvement over the streaming quality of just the i5, but there is no LESS quality to the streaming, and that's what matters. My monitor is a 32\" 1440p, with a 144 Hz refresh rate.\n\nI do, however, have a couple of issues with this card. On the product description page, there is clearly a picture of the various output I expected to find on this card. And if I remember right that picture had a display port, an HDMI port, a 24 pin DVI port, and a VGA port (I might be wrong about the VGA port). The card that arrived at my house, does NOT have either a VGA port or a display port. So, if your monitor has either of those, BUYER BEWARE!!! I was only ever going to use the HDMI port, so I'm not too fussed.\n\nMy bigger issue is the plastic shroud on the GPU itself. The card doesn't cover the same amount of area that the plastic shroud does, so I have several square inches of exposed plastic shroud inside my PC, acting as a \"bowl\" to catch any dust flying around. And while the Dell has a paper filter the covers the main air intake, and a sort of cone directing the CPU exhaust directly out into the room and that has kept the amount of dust inside my case to a minimum. But now there is the GPU fan sourcing air from an unfiltered area, and just exhausting the air inside the case. So, ALL bets are off as to how this plays out in the remaining life left in my aging Dell.\n\nThat is just BAD design all the way around. It uses more material than is strictly needed meaning the manufacturer is paying more than is strictly necessary for each card manufactured, and it CAN'T be good for the PC to have an actual dust catcher inside a machine that you work hard to keep dust free. And I can PROMISE the manufacturer, that if my aging Dell suddenly dies six weeks from now, I know EXACTLY who I will blame. I won't get a refund, but THEY won't get a return customer.\n\nAnd for that reason, ultimately, I will give this GPU a 3-star rating with a serious \"BUYER BEWARE\" due to the misleading product photos, as well as the poorly designed fan shroud."

It fits perfect and doesn't overlap on the 2240 M.2 SATA SSD (See photos). After installation NVIDIA program recognized the GPU and updated the software automatically. I'm not using this for games but I am using DreamWeaver, Photoshop, Illustrator etc... as well as ZOOM for online college courses and a couple of other graphics demanding programs. I didn't have to mess with or update the BIOS, it was simply plug and play. Temperature wise it stays pretty cool. The only modification was having to exchange the original GPU bracket with this 1030 bracket. It worked out fine. (See Photos)"

                    "text": "I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production. Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.) Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)\n\nThe only complaints I do have are about the cooling. The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself. It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.) This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out. I emphasize some because of two things. First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.) I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.\n\nI also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.) I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible. I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade. When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.) It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.\n\nThere was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.) For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape. This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it. For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime. For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.) Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting. Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.) Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)\n\nNow, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud. I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all. I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.) Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.) Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature. The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.) It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so. That 85% was only for a short duration.) I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening. Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier."

My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling."

The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nArrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this computer based on that alone."

I upgraded from the Rtx 2060 super and I can really tell the difference in frames at 1440p on my 165hz monitor, it\u2019s been about six months now and I haven\u2019t had any problems. But I will say that It can get kinda loud, I don\u2019t notice most of the time bc it\u2019s only in intense gaming and the game is usually loud too so unless I take my headset off I don\u2019t notice it. But it may be an issue if you have other people in the room trying to sleep or what not.it\u2019s fans have an option to stay off tho when using low power so that helps a lot to offset the noise issue. But anyway, this papacy all of my games at any setting I want and after using it for six months I can safely recommend this card to anyone, especially at its current price of ~600$ right now"

My case and case fans are cool and quiet, so not sure why its revving so loud, the game is not a tough game to run.

The only complaint that I have, is that it is way too bulky and big for my custom gaming desktop. I am not sure why but it just takes up so much space! Not to mention that you have to use the PSU cables, just to plug it up. (I am not really a fan of GPUs that require you to plug something up to it) It's asking price is pretty debatable too and they are becoming harder to find online! Hopefully when the 4000 Ti graphic card series is finally released to the public, ZOTAC will take notes and make their GPUS a little smaller, a certain percentage cheaper and will not require us to have to use PSU cables. I highly recommend this GPU over the now common 3060 Ti!"

If its below msrp, or even /slightly/ above, its definitely worth buying this card.\n\nNow that my cpu doesn't have to run graphics at the same time as other things (for reference it used to say in task manager my graphics was at 40% when I was using integrated even just basic website idling, now idle its barely at 5%), I have no doubt my computer will run way better and I'll had a better time gaming.\n\nTldr: Amazing card, but its better if you can buy it at a sale price as everything is hella inflated."

Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.\n\nWhile testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC.

I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy. It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game. The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds. Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super. I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570. The frame rates are incredible! Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card. I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream. The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play. I highly, VERY highly recommend this card! It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's. It's worth the price!"

Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I\u2019m using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it\u2019ll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I\u2019ve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I\u2019d expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn\u2019t very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I\u2019ve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card."

This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don\u2019t think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti.

This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far."

Then, this came along. I\u2019m a sucker for strix cards and had one been available(with a payment plan) I would have stayed true to Lisa Su. Instead, I went with the competition. I\u2019m still rocking a 5800x and Crosshair DTX motherboard. This combo is incredible together. You do have to fiddle with temps and find the right overclock. I finally found a stable 2010mhz overclock and that nets me some serious frames. I honestly feel bad not going AMD this time around cause they make a great GPU nowadays. Between this and an rx 6800xt, with either choice you won\u2019t be disappointed. Having access to ray tracing finally is nice. This GPU is beautifully made. I\u2019m not sad in the slightest with this card. Of course Nvidia being Nvidia quietly released the 12gb version. That\u2019s the only part about Nvidia that I dislike. You buy say, an RTX 3070. Then, Nvidia releases a tI version of the 3070, making your 3070 suddenly seem like a bad idea and wish you had just waited. That\u2019s another reason why I wait so long after a GPU launch. I want to wait and see how many variations get to the market before I decide. Even getting this 3080, when we\u2019re months from the new gen cards from both companies seems unwise. But, it will be at least a year or more before we know the full GPU landscape and I want1440p 100 FPS+, now."

I decided to give Amazon a second chance because of their overnight shipping and sent the first product back and for a refund. The second overnight shipment was a success and was a perfectly brand new ASUS 3080 that runs great! Amazon got my package and issued my refund in about a weeks time as well, so no complaints there.\n\nJust beware that there may be GPU swappers out there pulling things like this."

Because I belive in trying every possible situation by troubleshooting the part before just sending it back and maybe the same thing happens. This card got here May 1st. At first I only had 1 desktop and two laptops. Oh and trust me, I even tried the laptops, I bought a e2mc to usb chord, (e2mc is the new smaller adaptors for solid state hard drives and wireless cards, and yes you can plug into that put your card on a riser) Basically I tried everything. On the first card, I bought from this company it didn't work. With anything! I feel like the day it came in was the day I woke up and stepped into the outer ring of hell. Anything involving this product turns into work wasted. Can I at least send it back to you guys so I can get this paperweight of a reminder of this off my desk?"

Most cards that have an output layout like this are fake and, seeing reviews from people saying it won't run DX11, I'm inclined to believe this isn't even a 6770 as those did run DX11. The listed clock speed is about 200mhz lower than the original cards which, at best, points to these being faulty cards flashed with a different BIOS to operate at a lower clock speed. HD 5770s and 6770s (same card with 2 names) also NEVER came with 4GB of VRAM.\n\nAgain, this points to this being a card with a fake BIOS. I've tested another faked GPU claiming to be a GTX 960 4GB and the card even reported itself as such to the computer. In actuality it was a GT640 with 1GB of VRAM. When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash. In other words KEEP SHOPPING!"

                    "text": "in short, i have worked in tech support for over 20 years. due to declining health issues aka \"shaking\" and \"vision\", I no longer build systems. Sadly, my previous system was from 2009 and is able to run windows 10 professional. that stands for quality of the product; however, my income and credit has declined so i had to make compromises. end result, choose Zotac for a gaming type system ... not really for gaming but for content creation and 4K monitors. Yes, the system does run 3x 32 inch 4K monitors without any hiccup. It is whisper quiet so that is nice. The M.2 drive has quick access so summary that is the reason I got it. the root problem with Zotac, in comparision to other companies like Dell, is \"service.\" if you own an infinity you will get better service than if you own a \"toyota\" .... just saying. no disrespect to toyota ... we own one and this is our third toyota but pc service regardless of the company is key to me.\n\nnow to the complaint, you call their tech support and it doesn't state ... \"please hold\" .... like Dell you are the fifth person in line. Please hold or you leave your number for callback. What Zotac does is \"beep\" and expects you to know that the beep means leave a message. The second issue is after 5x tries to get tech support, i sent in an email. i get an email back that i should call. well i called, got sales, who couldn't transfer me to an agent. then i called customer service who said they are \"away\" from their desk. while on the call with customer service, tech support chimed in. Then the tech support guy didn't even ask for my \"order\" so that he could get the \"specs\" of the system. the company i work for, we use \"phone number\" searches, email searches, order searches, etc. to find their specs. Then, as most companies, verify the customer. then listen to the issue and pull up the specs of the system and then prompt remote access to the computer. he did remote access which i expected and had closed private information before hand. this is normal process at my company and they are fine with that process ... no complaints here. he looked up the motherboard but couldn't find the drivers for the wifi and the bluetooth PCI card that was attached. had you looked up the order and saw the details then downloading drivers is easy. end result, is the device doesn't have Windows 11 drivers ... but the issue isn't his fault for not having the drivers BUT not knowing what devices are installed in the system is \"low grade\" tech support. he should have access to the order info, look up the details, then down load the drivers. Even the windows 11 upgrade didn't find them. my work around was to use a 3rd party wifi device that I already owned and wifi now works. I don't use bluetooth because my mouse and keyboard are wired along with my wired speakers.\n\ni did get a warranty, but my issue is \"how\" did he \"assume\" that the wifi card isn't defective. re-seating the card is standard troubleshooting so i understand that process. I didn't have time to do that on the call. however, he didn't even have the \"drivers\" or know what card was installed.\n\njust word of caution ... they are cheaper but \"cheaper\" in the tech support area too. A similar Dell XPS system would cost $5000+ to get the same performance as the AMD and that's beyond my means having taken a 30% cut in pay to just get a job. A job is better income than \"unemployment\" ... everything else seems to work fine. I will note their \"documentation\" is less than favorable ... doesn't state what motherboard is installed on the system specs nor the details of what drives can be installed inside the chassis. for myself, my career goals are changing from database to developer and i need a system with large displays and no video lag so the game PC achieved my objective. everything is \"usb\" so using the \"hubs\" works for me. however, money and credit provided, I would have gotten a \"Digital Storm\" computer with far better service, hardware, and expandability than even Dell offers. for the now, a good gaming system if that's your need and NO didn't include a keyboard or mouse as the picture shows. i already use ergo keyboard and mouse anyway but that was mis-leading.\n\nDAY 2\nNote, I am A+ computer repair certified for last 20 years been doing repair. in short, reseated the Wifi / bluetooth card and still does not work. rebooted and search for drivers and still not found. update is that I have emailed the company for a callback on their \"registered\" phone number to avoid scammers. i will update and see if they will correct this issue and just send me a replace wifi / blue card.\n\nWEEK 2\n\nThe wifi and the bluetooth still DO NOT work. I installed a 3rd party USB card for expansion and had a few issues but that's a different story. now all the external hard drives with a faster connection than the SATA drives and I still don't have a returned instruction on how to attach the SATA drives. I did a little research on MSI website which is the mother board Type ... MSI MPG X570 ... basically a \"mini\" gaming motherboard. No SLI option on this motherboard in case anyone needs to know. for myself, 12GB of video RAM is for content creation so for my objective, it is fine. I will be trying to re-connect with Zotac support again regarding wifi and the bluetooth. If there is still no help, everything is working but I'll never buy from them again. With the ever increasing prices and shipping interruptions, I will just keep the system and add a second wifi card and go back thru my boxes of computer stuff for my bluetooth adapter. I really don't use bluetooth so no big issue but the principal is EVERYTHING should work out of the box.\n\nUpdate for Week 2\n\nTo date, the wifi doesn't work, hard to get hold of the tech support now that I am working a part-time job and they are NOT 24/7 hours at the convenience of the customer. They state the wifi/bluetooth card is fine which is INCORRECT. card has been res-eated and still not found. the models given don't match the models on the zotac site therefore what drivers do i install. in short, submitting CEO complaint to see if i can get adjustment. put in the 2nd USB card and using my personal wifi connection and found my bluetooth dongle and it now works. in short - don't buy from here unless you are short on cash like me. if i had to re-do and no finance issues, means buy from Dell or HP with a good warranty and ability to get a human 24/7.\n\nWeek 3 or something\nThought I had right address for CEO complaint and got letter returned. Due to all the shipping hiccups, I am keeping the system. Wi-Fi Bluetooth card yanked and using 2x usb hub cards with external Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. All works and and I have both usb and usb-c drives attached external thru hub.\n\nSUMMARY- if you want \u201cService\u201d this NOT the company to buy from."

                    "text": "First and foremost, this graphics card is great. The only thing I have some issues with is VR but everything else runs butter smooth. My original card was a GTX 1660 ti and was a really good card for the price but I started running into issues of modern games not running so great and constantly lowering quality of certain games. VR of course was always playable but I could definitely see the downgrade of my previous card so it wasn't the card itself but was my hunger for better gaming. The card gets a 5 star from me, it does exactly what it's supposed to do. My only small complaint is that the fans can get a bit loud from time to time but that isn't a deal breaker for me.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is having to deal with Amazon. My first hiccup was my original purchase was \"lost\" in the mail. I say \"lost\" because I don't believe my package ever was placed on a logistic vehicle and after about a week they finally decided to send a new unit. I did receive the replacement within one to two days so that wasn't a huge deal. I think me wanting the graphics card as soon as the site had said was what got me frustrated. When ordering the card there was a promotion for receiving three games after three business days of the card shipping and after the card is installed into your PC. I've been in contact with several support agents and at this point I'm just being ignored or passed along to another department. The promotion ended August 1st, I believe, but even before that the product page of the card I purchased stopped working completely so when I tried talking with a support agent they would have no way of looking it up. Luckily I screen grabbed the promotion listing with a bit of information linking the purchased card to the promotion but every time I mention this they tell me I'll get an email from a different department that \"specializes\" in the issue I'm having. I wanted to make this review strictly about the graphics card but had no avenue to review the product and the company separately, at least not from my knowledge of searching. I even contacted both Nvidia and Zotac and both companies said around the same thing that Amazon is responsible for game codes. I contacted those two companies because Amazon told me one of them was responsible for game codes which I later learned was just a dance to get me to go away.\n\nSo to summarize, I love the graphics card. Games look great, run extremely well and I'm overall very happy with my purchase. Amazon hubris has finally reached a tipping point where service is declining and support has been outsourced to other countries while not giving them the resources necessary to actually help customers. I've been an Amazon customer for over 15 years and have always been a cheerleader for the company but with all my shipping issues, customer support chats and calls the company is turning into just another faceless online store that cares very little about the people that got them where they are. I hope it gets better with the company because there was a time where Prime was an essential part of my life but am now questioning if it's worth it now. So Zotac RTX 3080 good, Amazon bad."

My GTX ran the same game @ 1920/1080p 60hz medium settings and stayed 82celsius basically the whole time the game was open. I bought this card within 10% of MSRP to future-proof my build so that hopefully I won't even have to look at the GPU market for another 5 years. My only complaint is the current state of the GPU market (Aug2021).\n\n(Edit 08/29/2021)\nI really hate to drop my review of this product to 3-stars because the seller is amazing and provided great customer service, I even found a friend in him. I'm dropping the rating because I just starting running newer titles on ultra that actually use a good % of the VRAM and wow, the manufacturer of this product either put little or no effort into the VRAM module thermals. I haven't opened the product to look at the thermal pad contact points yet *and may even not -so as not to void the warranty* but wow, I am disappointed in Zotac for letting this leave their factory. Its possible I just received an unlucky card but based on everything I've read online about GDDR6X thermal issues this is seems to be a wide-spread problem among just about every card that uses GDDR6X. The card works wonderfully for casual gaming but I can't actually use this card for stable Modern-Ultra-setting because the VRAM gets so hot that the GPU starts thermal-throttling @69C to prevent the VRAM from going over 82C. It's becoming clear that I'll have to either RMA this product and hope I get one with better thermal protection for the VRAM or \"go under the hood\" myself (void the warranty) and remove the cheap pads and place good ones. Very unfortunate."

Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.\n\nOkay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a \"boring\" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.\n\nAt the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600."

This card performs very well (on par with the 3060), at a much lower price. Unfortunately, AMD drivers are still a convoluted mess IMO compared to Nvidia Drivers. With their Adrenaline package having a ton of settings, if you're not familiar with it, you will spend literally hours playing with all the different settings. There are some cool features in it, but I wish AMD would focus more on overall PC performance and stability and less on trying to be the gaming king. You can ditch Adrenaline all together by using device manager to install STD drivers, but you lose \"ALL FEATURES\"....all or nothing? Not a good compromise.\n\nRSR- Radeon Super Resolution (Built into Adrenaline). It works well enough with upscaling and no real complaints (Works with most games) and is what I use for OW when I play.\nFSR 1- I do not play any games that utilize this.\nFSR 2- I believe only 1 game (Death loop) takes advantage of this.\n\nI run my security cameras, (Amcrest) through my rig for live viewing and have noted a degradation in overall performance compared to the old 1060 SSC 6G that was replaced with this card. Given this card is newer, better performing (physically)...I have to blame this on the drivers from AMD.\n\nOverall- good value, but I will most probably go back to Nvidia \"if\" the prices get better aligned with my budget. The VC is only part of the equation for a good performing card, but most critical are the Drivers. Because without solid drivers updated frequently, the best video cards are mediocracy at best."

Obviously this was a prime target-market for Nvidia's tip-tier GPU, so how they managed to release a flagship card with this incompatibility is baffling, but there you have it. So if you are planning to buy one of these for use with VR you'll want to wait until Nvidia has fixed the issue.

I had benched the old RX580 in various benchmarking suites, then the RTX3080, and was surprised that the numbers were as close as they were. I'm betting the PCI-e 3.0 is why.

                    "text": "User Experience and Price\nMy reason for getting this card was to play on a 4k 60hz tv, and to have newer features such as DLSS and ray tracing. (I had a 1070 ti prior and it could never fully handle 4k without scaling down to about 60-75% resolution on bigger titles from 2016+, especially without DLSS support.) The 3070 ti handles just about every title I've tried from 2020 and before at 4k with no need for DLSS or scaling, high to ultra. I would personally recommend it for 4k, but if it is priced closer to a 3080 than a 3070 i'd wait and get a 3080 for 4k. I wouldn't call playing dying light 2 with RTX on at 4k a very smooth experience with this card, but I also don't have a 3080 to compare that to. Revisiting some games at 4k on a tv brings back everything I forgot I missed from consoles, and most games have been buttery smooth. Dying light 2, and tiny tina's wonderlands have needed some tweaking down from ultra.\n\nForm Factor\nIt's Biiiig. I haven't had any case clearance issues with mid tower cases, but double check before you purchase. I had this in a build with a full ATX motherboard, and I was able to reach my cables around no problem (more on this later). The weight of this card introduces a little sag even while screwed into the case. While it is not drastic, in the future I would like to see an elegant solution included with heavy gpu's, be that an included riser, bracket, mount, or stand. If it's not secured and sagging at all I would recommend taking out the GPU before traveling or moving the computer. or at the very least lying the computer down to where the gpu is not being pulled down.\n\nMore on Size\n\n(This is mainly if you use a micro ATX motherboard) In the past week I rebuilt into a higher airflow case and had a motherboard issue (Not Due To This Card. For transparency and maybe helping someone to avoid the issue i caused, it was my own user error mixing an ARGB up with an RGB header while connecting case RGB, therefore frying my board.) This lead to me getting a Micro ATX motherboard. The issues with a Micro ATX board pairing with this card might be mitigated with some more planning time, a different model of board, cable extensions, or in my case compromises. I couldn't use 2 out of the 4 sata ports on the board due to the card covering half of them, but these sata ports were mounted to the board vertically (popping up from the board rather than sticking out to the right) If you plan on moving your computer around often after building i'd either recommend getting a full ATX motherboard, or making sure that if it's micro ATX that the sata ports are sticking out to the side as to not stress your sata ports or squishing the cables. Front audio and usb's were also impossible to get to on the smaller motherboard as the card covered those completely. I will not take a star off for this because I knew the risks of getting a cheaper smaller board, and I don't need those ports as i'm running all audio through the hdmi and back usb.\n\nPrice\n\nIf you are torn between a 3070 a 3070ti and a 3080 (as i was) it might help to know that the 3070 ti is about 8% to 12% faster than the 3070, and the 3080 is about 15% to 20% faster than the 3070 ti. As prices varied at the time of this purchase those were the numbers I took into account. At my time of purchase (april 2022) a 3070 was 100$ cheaper, and a 3080 was $400 more expensive.\n\nPower\n\nI would recommend 750 watts for your PSU if you have a more power hungry CPU, I tested this card on a 650 watt power supply with a 3900x and did a power scan with precisionX and it recommended I go up to 750 watts. It didn't crash or make noise on the lower wattage psu, but i do feel I was right at the limit, and I felt like I was before checking as well. Better safe than cardless.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a great card. It's nice to look at with it's massive RGB bar of light. It runs cool and quiet. EVGA has a stellar track record with it's customer service, and has a long warranty. For most people buying this should be as simple as making sure the PSU can handle it, plugging it in, and getting drivers installed."

The header on the card can control other RGB, but that header only goes out, so a incoming signal from the MB will not work, and my MB is control out also.\n\nI did try to OC it slightly about 3%, and had no issues, but tuned it back down since all three fans spun up very dramatically.\n\nIts's heavy, and sagged in my expansion slot, so I mounted it vertically in my case and bought an additional extension cable to connect it and an GPU brace support to help even with it off the mb."

Ive thrown every triple a game at it and it handled it amazingly. The only game i had an issue playing was starwars battlefront 2 and ultra high settings. Where my frames dropped below 60. But even then i think it was due to my motherboard having pci 3.0 instead of 4.0 and my cpu being a mid range 5600x. Besides that no issues at all. Temps are around 100 with just fan cooling. Highest ive ever seen it go was 140 in a hot room with no ac and even then if i use msi afterburner and turn fans up to 100% the temps drop 40 degrees and still the card has no frame drop ot throttle. Absolutely beast considering its like the top 3 on the market right now for nivdia. (Before 4000 series comes out). Highly recommend if you can find it at a low price."

The card was plugged in, wired with 2 8 pin dedicated connectors, and immediately booted up. Display resolution WILL be awful until you add drivers. Further, I recommend using AfterBurner and not Zotac excuse for an OC software, Firestorm. The LEDs are extremely bright out of the box, can be dimmed in Firestorm. I had to put a fairly aggressive fan curve on it to keep the card under 65C. Card plays PUBG 1440pUltra144, Fornite1440pUltra250+, BF2042 1440Ultra90~. Do not worry if the fans don't spin when you turn your pc on. Mine shipped with a 50C minimum temp to spin the fans. The card isn't terribly heavy, no real need for a support.\n\nEDIT: I worry that this card actually fried a PCIE slot on my Z370 Pro4 motherboard. I don't think that board was well suited for a card of this caliber. Z690, in my now current build, works flawlessly.\n\nThe system sits as a 12700k, 3080 12GB, 32GB of 3200mhz Corsair LPX, Aiza A300 (Lian Li O11 knockoff), EVGA G5 1000W, and MSI 360mm AIO."

I am experiencing stuttering when trying to play a game on one monitor, while watching a video in the other, something that my 1070 was able to do without the video stuttering, on the same settings. The card is very loud and runs very hot, making me need to reconsider my pcie slot usage so I can try to free up more space in front of the fans. And since installing the card I have experienced crashes of games and windows blue screens noticably more frequently than before installation. I even performed a clean install of the drivers to ensure there were no conflicts. I will keep the card since my 1070 didn't have many days left in it, but will definitely be thinking twice before buying for my next upgrade"

It is a 12Gb version that works on first installation after a quick driver installation and registration. I got the 4K 120Hz to post with my LG monitor with ease. My Elden Ring and Cyberpunk games are now a joy to run compared to my old Aorus GTX 1080 Ti. The very best part is that it is super compact and fits perfectly in my Lian Li case. RGB customization is easy to setup and is gorgeous; it is a perfect fit for my build! The card does not even sag when mounted to my Asus motherboard. The fans are quiet and turn off during this review and regular non-gaming use clocking consistently at 34-35'C. I have zero thermal concern during game play. I ask myself, \"How?\" How did they engineer this beast? For me, it is worth every penny and is a perfect successor to my GTX 1080 Ti Xtreme cards. I highly highly recommend this product (coming from an owner of Asus cards and 4 Gigabyte Aorus GTX 1080 Ti Xtreme cards, this is a huge compliment). And it looks better than the more expensive EVGA version. Bravo to Zotac!\n\nHowever, do your research of other cards from other third party vendors. They are all excellent cards. Do keep in mind that some cards are far superior compared to others, and their engineering limitations are not quite pronounced until enthusiasts push these cards to their limits."

I suspect that anything returned would be examined and tested. So far, no problems.\n\nI tested the card out on some gaming and it worked fine for what I play. It was also easy to setup. I booted and it took Windows about 30 seconds to find the drivers, setup the card and to arrange my dual monitors. I didn't even need to download anything. I also like that it is an ASUS card since my MB is also ASUS.\n\nIt also doesn't take up as much room. This card is shorter and not as thick as other cards. I was able to adjust my cables and even had enough slack to rearrange my cables in the case because I had a lot more room.\n\nIt also has the bonus of not drawing as much power. It only needed one of the AUX power cords and it is super quiet compared the my older card. It only has two fans and I can barely hear them over the other fans in the case, which is a nice change from my 390x which was extremely noisy.\n\nSo if you are looking for an inexpensive video gaming card, then this would be your pick."

EVGA has opted for three outputs with a DVI-D while the other minis have four outputs with three DPs and an HDMI.\n\nEDIT: Noise levels at factory settings are good under moderate and variable loads but mediocre under constant maximum load. This card is much quieter when undervolted but results may not be consistent. The card I received has severe coil whine.\n\nDesign and Size (3/5): I respect EVGA for the logic of this card\u2019s design. Most people buy a half-length card for being cheaper and tolerate the lower performance from a single fan cooler. The people who buy a half-length card for its length usually plan to stick the card into a prebuilt with only eight inches of clearance. Why not make a card that has great performance and fits most cases but also doesn\u2019t cost extra? The result is a brick-shaped cooler with copper pipes and a copper plate. However, it\u2019s not readily clear if this design outperforms a normal half-length design.\n\nThis design also has quite a few drawbacks. The largest drawback is the three slot design which is a problem for anyone who uses other PCI devices. If your PCI slots are low in the case then the intake fan won\u2019t have any clearance. If you own a case that only has two expansion slots then this card is a non-starter since it uses three slots. If you actually do have a case that can only take a half-length card then this card is also a non-starter.\n\nEDIT: The open air cooler is also side vented. This card will bake itself in slim cases with metal side panels. Make sure that your case has exhaust clearance. This card also does not have a fan idle mode.\n\nCompatibility (N/A): This card should work in most prebuilts. I tested this card in a Dell Optiplex 7010 (Ivy Bridge 2012). It even works with survivable temperatures (85C and 90% fan usage) in cases with almost no ventilation. This is a solid upgrade for prebuilts with an extra 8-pin connector.\n\nEDIT: Make sure the prebuilt case has clearance for the side vented exhaust.\n\nPower and Temperatures (5/5): This card is equal to the multi-fan designs that have been reviewed. It never gets close to thermal throttling.\n\nEDIT: Rating +1. The factory overclock does work. The aggressive clock boost made it really hard to evaluate if the overclock was functional. The card will even boost above the factory overclock in some cases. Heat and noise levels rise badly when it does though.\n\nNoise Levels (2/5*): The fan has a clean hum but does get noisy under load. In relative terms, the noise level is decent for a single fan card. In absolute terms, the noise level does get annoying if you have a quieter case or environment.\n\nI found that 60-70% fan usage was the threshold for \u201cannoying.\u201d When you reach this point depends on your system cooling. In my case, the noise level was fine when the card was under moderate load (50-70%) with periodic load spikes. However, when the card was under constant maximum load, the fan was unable to control heat while also being quiet.\n\nThe card I received also had severe coil whine. EVGA does regard severe coil whine as a defect and is willing to replace a card that has it.\n\nEDIT: Rating +3 (only with undervolt). I was able to reduce the overall heat and power usage by reducing voltages and limiting the maximum frequency. I was then able to reduce the fan usage from 70% to 50%. The final result was a card that is both quiet and cold.\n\nThe problem is that \"undervolting\" is tedious to stability test. There's an extra level of technical knowledge required to set up a VF curve in Afterburner or Precision. Results also may not be consistent. Other cards may require more voltage to run stable. The out-of-box noise levels for this card are still bad. I wouldn't advise this card without a decent undervolt.\n\nI'm using a VF curve that mostly limits the card to its factory overclock of 1755 MHz @ 0.8V, down from 0.9V. Memory is 7500 MHz, up from 7000 MHz. The fan curve is 33-50% from 0-75C and 50-70% from 75C-100C.\n\nThese are fairly conservative settings. I think there is overhead for an overclock with the undervolt, but I was trying to lower fan usage below the threshold that I found bothersome.\n\nThe severity of the coil whine was much greater than I originally thought. When I spoke with EVGA, they said it was a defect and offered upfront to authorize an advanced RMA. They'll send me a new card first and then I'll send this card back. They'll pay for shipping both directions.\n\nThis response is excellent. However, I'd rather not play the coil whine lottery. I don't know if the problem is the card or the card series.\n\nDisplay Outputs (4/5): I\u2019m not sold on DVI-D in 2019, but for people who still need this output, EVGA has the only mini card on the US market with one. I prefer the other minis with four outputs. It also doesn\u2019t have USB-C, but most cards don\u2019t have this output, so EVGA doesn\u2019t lose any points for this.\n\nAesthetics (3/5): There\u2019s no backplate which is a cheap move for a card of this price. The minis from Zotac and MSI have backplates. The color scheme is black and grey with no lighting. There\u2019s no green aside from the \u201cXC\u201d text on the side.\n\nFinal Score (3.5/5*). This loses the most rating for having coil whine and loud fan with the factory settings. Having no backplate is a stingy exclusion. I dislike the output selection. It\u2019s highly dubious to exchange two DisplayPorts for one DVI-D. Adapters aren\u2019t rare or expensive. It\u2019s also ironic that I can\u2019t use this card with the EVGA Nu Audio sound card. This card is too large for both of them to fit.\n\nEDIT: Rating +0.5 or more (only with undervolt). My opinion of this card has improved after undervolting. This card's noise level still kind of sucks out of the box. I'm not entirely sold on design choices and I'm slightly concerned about the coil whine. I'm not sure if I'll accept the RMA offer, and I still might return this pending reviews for the half-length cards from Gigabyte and MSI."

I'm not disappointed. My old AMD HD Radeon wasn't cutting it with 1080p conversions so I got this so I wouldn't burn out my 2nd Gen Intel CPU. My machine now runs conversions with no CPU load. I decided to try it on all of my old games (hl, hl2, counter-strike, even quake/quakeII) with the highest absolute max settings and get exceptionally high framerates. Even WoW runs at over 60fps. I can't hear the GPU cooler over my chassis fans. My old card sounded like a hair dryer.\nEven though I expect the price to fall further, this was still an excellent buy at $230.\nThe card has generous GDDR6, decent clock speed, plenty of CUDA cores, (and Ray Tracing) for that price. And I compared them ALL. To be honest, the next-day shipping option tipped the scales a bit. But I traded that off for aesthetics. Although it is extremely well-built and looks good, the card isn't a showpiece with disco lights. The back of the card shows circuitry instead of a finished coverplate. On the plus side, better cooling."

I got 26,248 (not overclocked, default voltage). Median score is 23,115 on PassMark website. I'm very pleased with this result. Games look amazing!

Two things to note. First, my PSU is 550 watt, which is plenty for max TDP of 220 watts. Second, another reviewer said they needed a PCE cable that didn't split, but I used one that split and got the above Passmark score and GeForce Experience confirms it reaches 100% in some games.\n\nAs for games, I wanted to mention Doom Eternal runs at on max settings (100+fps 1440p). Elden Ring runs at max settings (60fps 1440p) typically using only 50% of GPU. As for the new Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, I cannot run at max settings, but the fps is consistently good enough on high settings (60+fps 1440p). That game is also a CPU hog with Ray Tracing/DLSS on max distance (using 50%+ of my Ryzen 5 5600X 6-core) . The temps were building up with both the CPU and GPU running under heavy load, but it was stable and the game is beautiful!"

I'm running warzone and black ops on max settings with literally zero issues. Black Ops was for sure the hardest test. Warzone would run decent on my gtx 1660 if I kept the in-game graphic settings just right but literally nothing I did could fix black ops after two patches ago. My game looked like ***t, and there was no fixing it. I installed the MSI RTX 3070, booted it up, maxed out settings, checked gpu temp, and everything is smooth as it can be. Low temp, high performance, and insane visuals! Buy it! Don't shop around. Buy THIS card!"

Temperatures get as high as 85C if I don't adjust the fan curve. When I set the fan speed to 90% it never goes above 70C under heavy load. The fans are also not that loud surprisingly.\n\nA con I would say is that the fan blades look very cheap and flimsy. It does the job but I can't help think that a blade or 2 might break off.\n\nI know these gpus should be cheaper by now since next gen are coming. But economic problems and Nvidia protecting profit complicate price drops. It's amongst the cheapest 3070 but performs quite well.\n\nMust be used in a well ventilated case since it doesn't push air out."

I got it for $240, which is easily the best value for an upgrade I have ever done. I debated going to a higher resolution monitor, upgrading my CPU and going with something like a 3070, but that all in cost would be about $1800 when you factor in all the components. Terrible value compared to this little sub $300 upgrade! I'm digging 1080p gaming again (actually for me it's 1920x1200 with my 16:10 monitors)."

I counted on Amazon's liberal return policy and took the gamble. I changed to the low-profile bracket, ditching the VGA port and downloaded the latest NVIDIA drivers. I'm pleased to say this card and its 4GB are running two 27\" monitors essentially straight from setup. I don't know why other reviews can't run more than one monitor, but I also don't know their level of expertise. I come from that 90's & 2000's group that went and got bits and pieces at Fry's and popped them into the computer case, learning by trial and error. I'm no expert, but I can get by.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing in the box other than the card and the low-profile bracket. You'll have to go to NVIDIA dot com to get your drivers. I disk or leaflet with minimal instructions wouldn't go amiss with some of the purchasers.\n\nAnyway...good video card, reliable (so far) after four weeks, and I'm happy with my purchase."

The Amazon website had a lot more information than the box.\nThe Amazon website says that KAER offers 24-hour technical support, but doesn't say what the URL for that is and neither does the box. www.kaer.com is an air-conditioning company, and Google just turns up a ton of false hits.\nWhen I installed the card and turned the CPU on, it only detected one monitor and was confused about it. Windows -> System -> Display says it was 1024x769 with no other options, but stuff that was supposed to be in the center of the screen was at the edge of the screen. Websites kept coming up where the buttons were off the bottom of the screen when the top of the window was at the top of the screen.\nThe colors were all wrong, too.\nI figured it was a driver problem, so with great difficulty I went to the NVIDEA website and downloaded the driver for the NVIDEA Geforce GT 730 (the box says nothing about NVIDEA and there are no directions, I was just going by what the Amazon website said).\nInstalling the driver made no difference.

While this card is a tad expensive it is not priced at the ridiculously insane prices of the middle to high end gaming video cards in 2022. This GPU has done the job of letting me go anywhere on the internet without video lag.\n\nI had a more expensive NVIDIA GPU in my system with otherwise state of the art hardware. The newest most power Ryzen 9 \\ 5900 CPU, fast memory and a 750 watt power supply. The NVIDIA GPU ran like hot garbage on my Ubuntu system. Ubuntu has a nasty sepia color scheme that saturates the entire OS and everything in it. It is not only ugly but painful to look at due to my vision issues.\n\nI did not know for sure at the time but, I hoped a new video card from someone other than NVIDIA might perform better. Turns out this AMD designed GPU got rid of the nasty sepia tint. This video card creates a simple un-tinted OS that is a pleasure to use. The card is not BIG and uses only the power supplied by the GPU slot.\n\nThe card has some energy saver garbage installed that turns the card off if you power down your monitor. I took a star off for the energy saver mess. There really are no other issues. This is a great card to use on a Linux\\Ubuntu system that is not used for hard core gaming."

I got it for $240, which is easily the best value for an upgrade I have ever done. I debated going to a higher resolution monitor, upgrading my CPU and going with something like a 3070, but that all in cost would be about $1800 when you factor in all the components. Terrible value compared to this little sub $300 upgrade! I'm digging 1080p gaming again (actually for me it's 1920x1200 with my 16:10 monitors)."

                    "text": "First and foremost, please do not buy this if you plan to use this *exclusively* for gaming; you'd be much better served going with a 3080 price/performance wise. (Unless an extra $300 for more or less 10% performance gain is worth it to you then go for it, I suppose. It is a 3090 after all.)\n\nHowever, if your workflow can properly utilize the massive 24GB worth of VRAM a 3090 comes with, this is well worth it. Quite literally, there are no other nVidia cards at this price point that offer this amount of VRAM. Now sure, there are rumored cards and workstation level graphics cards that out perform the 3090, but they are vastly more expensive, so if you're looking to do some serious ML prototyping/3D-modeling etc but don't want to go through the hassle of spinning up a cloud GPU instance (and burn through credits) this is the way to go.\n\nWith regards to this specific card, please note that while EVGA had a lot of growing pains with the initial release of the 3090, as of now these issues have all but been solved. If you are worried about rumors of VRM failures etc, just make sure your card is not rev0.1(which you'll find next to the pcie slot). The ugly red \"clown lips\" at the edge of the card have also been removed in these newer iterations; however, if your card does have those, you can email EVGA for a replacement shroud. Thermally, this card is decent; however, it is helped significantly with some undervolting. My personal undervolt is 1890 @0.9V, which drops overall energy usage of this card by upwards of 100W. Design is quite elegant with the diffused RGB LEDs and a solid feeling of construction throughout. The precision x1 software is solid for both RGB and undervolt/overclock control.\n\nAll in all, this card as this price point ($1000 or so) is a steal if you can properly utilize the 24GB of VRAM. The card's construction, thermals, and warranty support from EVGA are all superb and I would definitely recommend this product."

It\u2019s not for people running lower resolutions like 1080p or for people running older games that are not graphically demanding.\n\nIt is however a complete powerhouse of 4K gaming. This card can max out every game I own in 4K except Cyberpunk 2077 with Ray tracing. But Cyberpunk is ridiculous so I don\u2019t know if that really counts.\n\nThe gaming capabilities are over the top and you pay a lot for that. You will not be upset if you bought this card for gaming. But if you bought it for 3D art or graphics design, you\u2019ll be even more excited. It performs so smooth and renders artwork so quickly that it makes your projects so much more simple to work on.\n\nAll in all, the only negative I have ran into with this GPU is the increased fan noise over my old card, but this is mostly because the 3090 comes with 3 fans instead of 2. My number one tip for new users would be to go and modify your fan curve right away as this card is set by default to not hit max fan levels until 90c which is just dumb. With a more aggressive curve set, I am able to easily keep temps in the mid 70s while gaming in 4K and pushing the card as hard as I can.\n\nAll in all this is the best purchase I have made for a PC in many years.

I've seen them hit 105\u00b0C before thermal throttling took place. According to Samsung(who manufactures those chips), that's the danger zone. So I had to fully water cool with an active backplate from Bykski, which keep the temps stable at about 70\u00b0C between the GPU and vram. I feel like this shouldn't be a problem as much as the card costs. Then doesn't think this through I think. A fan or something should've been implemented for the top memory chips. Beware, even with proper intake and exhaust on your case, you'll still have this problem.\n\nAfter the last two years of inflated prices, I've finally gotten my hands on a 3090 at a really good price. I paid the same for this thing as I did for my 2080ti, and for an extra 2000 points added to my Time spy score without any overclocking. It never hit over 75\u00b0c with stock fans. I never really heard the game like everyone claims but then again, my hearing is almost shot anyway.\n\nI did find a hybrid kit for this(had to pay double MSRP because of scalpers) but it ended up being worth it. Maxed at 60\u00b0c with the fans blowing out on Time spy (gonna flip to pull cool air in) and still got a high score. Next step: overclocking."

Second, i loath overclocked cards. They don't run efficiently. I really don't like this thing where you can't even get a normally clocked card anymore. it's also has a dual bios.. cool-- when you run in the efficiency zone cards are so much more efficient and quiet, for very little speed loss. Is it worth running your cards at 90c vs 60c for 5%, all the noise heat etc etc, i don't think so, and with dual bios anyway you can decide and not rely on software across operating systems. If you look at the xbox series x they clock low for the same reason. You've got PlayStation doing all this liquid metal stuff. I think it's a recipe for returns and issues long term. TBH, and probably why they jumped to 6nm as soon as they could. This card is perfectly balanced is high end and runs right in the zone, with an overbuild but not overly expensive build.\n\nThe amd software is actually fantastic. I like it better than NVidia's now. I've not had crashes and will continue to demand that. Software stability is more important than anything else to me. Even one bluescreen or crash it totally unacceptable. I also like that this works with linux, and i don't need to register like with Nvidia. Nvidia works with linux but the support sucks for dual monitor/video card which i used.\n\nMy thing with GPUS now is these manufactures try to differentiate on that feature which i don't want. what i'd prefer is quieter, better built, dual bios good quality fans that run for a decade since these cards are so powerful we'll be with them for a while, more open standards like fsr so after the support windows we can keep relevant longer. Look to nvidia and see rebar, or dlss not getting backported to cards it should have, or some upscaling version. Let's be real we've read a point where this card will be relevant for 10 years. maybe not the best or whatever that will change in a month, but it will not need to be replaced (much like a cpu). Your at least 2x over consoles here.\n\nCouple things about this design that can be improved.\n\nit's thicker than it needs to be. There is a lot of space between the shroud and heatsink. I 'd love the 5 ports 3 display port 2 hdmi, or 1hdmi and a usb c. It doesn't have dlss, and the raytracing isn't as good. I can easily rationalize that by the fact that i paid under 600, and even at that price point nvidia isn't competitive. I also don't really like raytracing but i like having the option. I mean sure a 3070 ti, or 3080 is better raytracing but that's 100 more, and by the way i've tried raytracing it's wasn't a big deal to me, and none of the cards have enough power for me to feel confident they'll work in the next 4 years for whatever gets cooked up there. I would prefer having dlss too, but i think the intel one at least works which can be probably utilized here as well. I'm an upscale fanatic, the artificing bothers me zero, and it's a way i can get more value out of my hardware. I simply love fsr, fsr2 and dlss the more the better as far as i'm concerned. This card can handle 2/3 of the ones out and i like fsr 2 the best i think from an engineering pov (open standard).\n\nOn value:\n\nHonestly what is going on now and the last few years> inflation is bs. you need to time this. Picking up a 6800 xt or 6900 xt for under 600 500 is best... should be our aim as a gpu community (or a 3080 if they ever do that). I also think to be honest though if you go amd i'd consider 6700xt, 6800xt 6800 or 6900xt they are all fine for almost all games. Don't let anyone tell you the 6700xt is bad. It is not. 6800xt and 6900xt have almost no differences for most just get the 6800xt. If you can get it under 500 your amazing. I was on fence and paid a touch more. I would definitely get this over an over clocked 6800xt if the price is the same at 550 it was less.\n\nNvidia makes good stuff i have pascal. i've been in pc gaming my entire life. I paid 400 for the 1080 ti is as far as i'm concerned for its time and generation by far the greatest card ever made, but i was so turned off what they did with the 40 series (4070), and given that amd is ok, i 'm switching back to that for a few years. They are what i used before maxwell, as well as some of the other manufactures that are gone now. I may also look at the 7000 series next year after the dust settles and keep this in my other machine, and i want to pick up an Arc gpu. The a770 is going to be fantastic value if you have rebar. Why buy now -- same reason i got my 1080 ti when Turing released. I've been trained to buy last gen, and demand deals even more now because the prices are ABSURD. -- it's getting a little hard to tell what's going on in the world right now. I get that everyone says if bad things happen a gpu is the least of your concerns, i agree, however it 's nice to be able to game and take your mind off all the insanity as well.\n\nI see price here is 699, i'm not sold on that. Just wait if that's the price you're getting. Check around you can find this for under 600 if you use that zip payment thing on another site. I like amazon the best but this is like 150 more. The default is always amazon though. In conclusion, remember this card was 1k, then > 2k, then 1k just 4 months ago. When you see the new stock and the new prices hold. We have the power here, and what' s been happing to the pc gaming community is wrong, but also our own doing. The new stuff is likely to be this price in a month. So pay less. ideally 500's."

In comparison to the whole debacle with cheaper MOSFETs with the other budget friendly brands from other manufacturers, ASUS fortunately stuck with their guns and stayed with higher quality components, despite this being the \"cheaper\" option in their lineup.\n\nWhen running this card in OC Mode and using their Asus GPU Tweak II to enhance the overclock, this card ran at max 70C and continued to keep a steady clock above 1770MHZ as advertised. I am sure there is a little bit more headroom that can be done if you manually overclock and fiddle with the settings which goes to show the quality of the card.\n\nIf you are considering buying an RTX 3090 then you are already aware of the horrendous performance per dollar in comparison to the RTX 3080 when it comes to gaming workloads specifically. However, if you are going to buy one, you were already aware of that. But it still makes sense to try and get the most out of your money and in this case if you are looking for a sleek, high quality, and well performing card then this one is definitely a top contender.\n\nAs of this review, the exemption of GPU's from the tariffs in China has just expired, and thus GPUs are now seeing a massive increase in price from 8 - 25%. This card retailed for $1599.99 prior to the tariffs exemption, now they are retailing on Asus' site for $1839.99. Unfortunately, this has applied to all other manufacturers as far as I am aware and really makes purchasing the RTX 3090 for gaming workloads specifically an even harder buy. Of course this card is a good value for workstation use in comparison to last gens Titan RTX but again, with non-existent stock and now tariffs on top of this, I wish you best of luck in procuring one until demand is finally met."

I'd really been aiming for a 3080 or 6800 XT, but got impatient enough that the 3090 actually in my cart (!!) was irresistible. Three weeks in, I have absolutely no regrets.\n\nThe RTX 3080 is a far better value proposition if you can find one at MSRP, and the ASUS TUF Gaming version is physically almost identical (visually indistinguishable) from this 3090. That being said, I do take some comfort in knowing that with 24GB of VRAM this GPU will not need upgrading for several years.\n\nThis card is beautifully built, fast, cool and quiet. I have not pushed its limits, but a modest overclock (on top of the factory OC) of core and memory clock speeds can be easily accomplished with no significant increase in temperature or fan noise. Serious overclockers should look elsewhere (and spend even more for ROG STRIX, Aorus Extreme, etc.) because the TUF 3090 is BIOS-limited to 107% of stock power, or 375 watts.

                    "text": "I previously had a EVGA GTX 1660 Super in my system and this is such a huge upgrade. Last year during The Great GPU Shortage, I bought a 165hz/1440p monitor which was a small oversight as my GPU clearly couldn\u2019t even handle my monitor. Fast forward to now, I recently got a pay bonus from work and was back in the computer component market after seeing that GPU prices had dropped significantly. I\u2019m very content with the price I paid for this 3080. Now onto the GPU itself.\n\nThe negatives:\n- It is quite the space heater. A factor might be that I temporarily moved my setup into my bedroom from the office/studio to accommodate a guest. I also have case fans manually set to 100%, so I might tinker with that a little bit. It raised the ambient temperature of my room by probably around 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit (yeah pretty bad).\n- It\u2019s a CHONKER. GPU sag may occur. I bought a bracket/riser after I received it, since I didn\u2019t know how large it would be.\n- Not really a negative, but please, please buy a PROPER power supply to support this card. I\u2019ve heard horror stories.\n\nThe positives:\n- The performance is awesome, I\u2019m actually able to reach 165 fps + 1440p on most games if I tweak the settings a little bit. I\u2019ve been playing Forza Horizon 5 a lot and I have it set to mostly the highest settings (there\u2019s a driver bug with the game currently, no biggie, barely see any difference anyway) and I get over 140 fps on average.\n- Ray-tracing! It\u2019s a given but honestly, I only turn this on for non-competitive games and if I don\u2019t mind being below my personal target of 120-144 fps.\n- The noise! It\u2019s been really quiet for the most part, but keep in mind that I previously said I had the case fans set to 100% so that\u2019s probably drowning the GPU fans out. Your mileage may vary here.\n- Streaming/recording! I really like NVENC. While my previous card also had NVENC, it could not keep up streaming while gaming. I also have a Ryzen 5 3600 (yes I know I\u2019m slightly bottlenecking, I have heard this many times), and while that CPU is a beast, it just simply doesn\u2019t like being put to the streaming/recording tasks solo when gaming. It needs it\u2019s good ol\u2019 GPU encoder friend.\n- I\u2019ve owned 3 EVGA cards now including this one, and they\u2019ve all been reliable so far. EVGA gets a plus here for that.\n\nIn conclusion, get this card if you have the capable budget and/or you\u2019re looking to get some massive upgrade gains. Like I said, I don\u2019t have the best CPU to support this, but it\u2019s been working great so far."

Once I used this new cable the image is fine. What's weird is that the old 4k HDMI cables I used are fine now too. Very strange. Not sure why it decided that the cables weren't adequate after a week of working just fine, and now they are fine again. I'll just use the display port to HDMI cable going forward. It unlocks the 4k 120hz option via display port anyway. I hope this might help others having a similar situation. I'm glad I don't have a dead card and get to enjoy how awesome this beast is. 4 stars for hassle and the issue being an arbitrary vendetta the card had with cables that it now works fine with.\n\nOriginal review:\nI was very excited that the prices were finally reasonable so I took advantage and went for it. I was excited that it came in one day! installed it with no issues at first, updated all the drivers and bios for my motherboard, and enjoyed a few days of beautiful textures and frame rates at much higher settings than my tired old EVGA GTX 970 SSC could hope to accomplish. Then the fateful day, exactly one week into ownership I changed a couple settings in a game after a benchmark and quit the game. Out of nowhere my screen starts to strobe and flicker, then it went solid green. I restarted the computer and got this beautiful image.\n\nI tried different cables, but this is all I see. I installed the old trusty 970 again with the first cable, and it works just fine. I tried putting them both in at the same time to access the settings for each card while I can actually see anything. Everything is up to date and it claims from device manager to be working but this is the only video output I see from the card. Tried different monitors and a TV. Reinstalled drivers, changed the resolution and refresh rate. Went back into that game and reset settings. I don't know what else there is to try.\n\nI've always bought EVGA cards after my first fiasco into PC building when I had to replace a dead card with an EVGA GTX 460, then I had 2 GTX 660ti SSC cards, and my 970. I have never been let down until now. I'm not really sure if I should just try a replacement, or a different brand altogether. The ASUS TUF is supposed to be one of the other top versions of the card.. maybe that's what I'll do."

However, it's important to understand that unless the software is optimized to use the GPU it won't make any difference whatsoever, as I am witnessing, having upgraded from an NVIDIA 8gb Quadro M4000. In head-to-head comparison 95% of tasks and applications I use, there is absolutely no discernible difference. Of specific disappointment are my video applications which claim to be able to use the modern 2060 GPU for better overall performance but again I am seeing absolutely no difference between the two including conversion time or rendering. I run a brand new xps 8950 i5-12600k w. 32gb of ddr5 ram and a primary NVMe SSD along with a variety of other SSD's and one 7200rpm spinner. By all accounts I really expected this system to show remarkable improvements but alas none to be found except for the 5% gaming that I occasionally do where this new 2060 GPU just shines blindingly like I've never seen anything else before in my entire life of building and owning computers. Bottom line - prices have come down and occasionally EVGA even has direct to consumer sales at super competitive prices, however this is still a very expensive GPU if you're not a gamer, work with massive data, or use GPU intensive engineering type applications. Ultimately it serves little or no purpose for almost all your other processing sort of like having a 1000 hp engine in a car that's always driving 65mph. Nevertheless, if you still want some bragging rights especially on the benchmark software which shows this EVGA 2060 to be literally off the charts in my current configuration, by all means I encourage you to buy it. It truly is a remarkable piece of computer engineering and something you can hang on for many, many years to come."

First, its mounting plate and heatsink are very well engineered. It is much better than the flimsily designed Zotac and EVGA card interface. There is a lower chance of card sagging when it mounts horizontally or vertically. It is clearly designed for overclocking enthusiasts as both VRM's and heatsink designs are clearly geared toward extreme performance. Do make sure that you have at least two (if not three) 8-pin cables (150 Watts each) and PCI-E (75 Watts) connections at minimum in order to run this card properly.\n\nI have used many RTX 3080 12G cards from various third-party vendors. This card replaces the Aorus Master as my favorite from the perspective of performance and ergonomic. If I had to pick just one card for this generation of RTX 3080 12G at $800 USD, this would be the one. Of course, personal tastes and preferences prevail; still, in my humble opinion, the Strix Card is the best offering on Amazon.com, of course, excluding the entire class of water cooled graphic cards. Keep in mind that I have yet to see a single RTX 3080 or 3090 card that adequately performs in VR. Glitches in the refresh rate recur despite multiple attempts to resolve this problem with different game drivers among many cards on many board producers across 5 different GPUs. In short, do not update for your VR needs as the GTX1080 Ti performs much better compared to the glitchy RTX 3000 cards. NVidia needs to step up to fix this problem, and no new cards, not even with the RTX 4000 cards, should ever again be recommended for VR use until adequate quality control has been effectively implemented by NVidia."

The first thing you need to know is that this thing is power hungry and will create more heat because of that. Something to note if you are upgrading from a lower end GPU. The dual bios switch comes set to performance mode which has an aggressive fan curve and will run cooler but louder. The opposite if you switch to quiet mode. This is more of an enthusiast's GPU and if you are looking for quieter and cooler then I'd recommend the Tuf series. It actually doesn't run very hot, it just sheds it's heat well, so you'll want be aware of that. With a few tweaks it's possible to get your fps into the realm of 3080ti and 3090 land. It's rigid enough that I don't notice any sagging in my rig. Coil whine? None here. Luck of the draw? Maybe. But having a higher end PSU (you get what you pay for) and not daisy chaining the PCIE cables does help."

That is the only way I heard it. Unless you're PC is OPEN and you don't headphones or earphones then you might hear it but even then it really isn't that notable. I give this GPU a 10/10."

If you set the video for anything less than that. the game doesnt play smooth because the processor is old and not fast enough for the game or the video card. So if you have an old system like I do. Make your gpu do most of the work by playing at your native gpu monitor settings.. let the video card absorb the graphics since it has 4gb and let your old processor push the gpu along. The gpu is quiet it works. Its faster than what is advertised. this is the 128bit 4gb 192GB.......... per second updated video card 896 cuda cores.. the normal gtx 1650 is 128 bit 4gb 128GB....... per second 896 cuda cores.. So this gpu has faster memory and can handle more megabytes per second and it seems to be just as fast as faster than the super version.. If this video card last. This is a deal. I paid 325 for this video card in 2021. New.. It use to cost half the price but there is a gpu shortage in the world.. Currently ... I have had this card exactly two weeks. I prefere EVGA products but I have noticed Zotac around for years and years and havent heard anything bad about it. Stable using Aida Extreme. Currently at idle posting this review it says this gpu is using 32.63watts.. My old gtx 460.. yes 460 I think uses as much as 170 watts. I think they said this gpu uses max 75 watts.. I am happy with this gpu. Not the price, but the gpu .. If you have a ryzen cpu 6 core or better and 16gb of ram you will fly through many games, using this video card. This is an FX 8310 CPU that I am using has 8 cores stock3.4 overclocked to 3.8.. I didnt overclock to 4.0 if I didnt need to. Apparently I dont need to...That means with the gpu I can play many games.. Back For Blood was released this year I believe in October 2021 ... I am playing an updated brand new game in 2021 with a cpu that came out in 2014 all old equipment asrock 970m pro 3 , ddr3 gskill memory, zotac 1650 ddr6 version and a samsung 970 ssd drive. Go on youtube and type the type of cpu you have and video card you want and see what games people are able to play using what you have. if you have phenom then type that and the game you want. if you have fx 8350 ... type that and the game that you want.... the video card will work for many games. You just need to make sure your cpu is also strong enough to not bottleneck your game play as much , so everything will be smooth"

I would highly recommend over Radeon RX 550 or GeForce GTX 1050 Ti OC.\n\nReason for Purchase: Upgrade old PC with onboard graphics to be able to play games. The main concern was that the power supply was able to handle powering the card. Since it did not come with added GPU power I opted for a low power card to save on upgrading the power supply also.\n\nPC Specs:\n- Asus VivoPC K31CD\n- 8GB DDR4-2400\n- CPU Gen 7 i5 quad core 3Ghz\n- Power Supply: 300 Watt (No graphics card power available, Needed to be powered by the PCI-E bus)\n\nPurchased:\nThis graphics card and 32GB (Max) DDR-4\n\nI was planning on getting the Radeon RX 550 at first or the GTX 1050 Ti OC because this was an old under-powered PC and I wanted the most bang for the buck. My newest MacBook Pro has the 550 in it and it handles my steam games good, but struggled on Quern at high res (21 FPS). So I was leaning toward the 1050 Ti when I came across this beauty. It claims to be 50% more powerful than the 1050 and it was actually cheaper so I went for it.\n\nIt had no issues with power and handles Quern at 60-70 FPS. This was my benchmark since the 550 seemed to start choking around that. Also tried Factorio, Skyrim, Borderlands, and BioShock Infinity. All older games but it handled them all wonderfully. Very successful upgrade."

Second, if you're like me, and you just bought a new 2022 HP or a Dell (in my case the HP Pavilion Desktop PC TP01-2000i) with tons of RAM and a super-fast 11th gen Intel processor and an SSD and were very excited until you popped the hood and realized that the power supply (PSU) is proprietary, has no available power cables, and doesn't pack enough power to run your dedicated video card even if it did, this is your ONLY cost-efficient solution. The Intel 750 UHD that came with my new HP computer is awful. I score in the mid 20th percentile on 2D and 3D tests using Performance Test 10.1 even with the 11th gen processor and 64GB of RAM. I need a dedicated GPU for video editing, and the Zotac is one of a few reasonable solutions because it's compact and fits in the small space available (see photo) and does NOT require external power. It works great with the 310-watt PSU in my HP even though it says it requires around 375 watts. Not a problem. Best part is that I'm now getting close to the 60th percentile on 2D and 3D tests using Performance Test, which is a massive upgrade over the integrated Intel UHD 750. I don't game hardly at all, but according to \"Can I Run It?\", I could, if I wanted to, play 96 out of the top 100 games. With 4GB of fast onboard RAM, I'll be able to do what I need to do in the way of video editing. What a relief. I should have done more research on the computer I bought it, but at least I can do what I need to do now."

If anyone in the future is reading this. Yes i got it work, yes it was a PITA to figure out. Step1 update to latest BIOS. Step2, remove any graphics cards (i had the stock GT730 card), and boot to bios with onboard video. Step 3, reset bios to defauls. Step 4, change to IGP (used to be auto), and set to multimonitor). Step5, leave monitor plugged into onboard video, and install 1650. Step 6, boot windows 10 and install nvidia drivers. Step 7, shutdown move to the monitor output of the 1650, and boot into windows... at this point it works great for me. I suspect this will be similar to other lenovos so it might give others hope.\n\nNow why 4 stars? 1 overpriced for what it is... 2 it is just not very fast, but i guess we take what we can get, given the package limitations."

It's effectively a 4K display that's been given a haircut from 2160p to 1600p.\n\nThis \u2026 isn't really a 4k gaming card IMO. I hate to say that because I'm really very unhappy with Nvidia these days, but they've got faster hardware and until recently (as of this writing in August 2022) they could and did put whatever stupidly ridiculous price on it they wanted because you'd pay it if you had to. (Not that AMD was going to leave that money on the table either, but Nvidia was the one driving.)\n\nThis card is not going to get high framerates in Cyberpunk 2077 on 4k high settings. It's going to be beat pretty solidly by cards in its price class from team green. If you moderate your expectations a little for what you're paying for the card, it's going to do all right in 1440p, though.\n\nI'm running it in between those two resolutions: 3840x1600, on an ultrawide that is effectively 75% of a 4k display. You're not going to get 60fps on this in Cyberpunk 2077 at high details at that resolution without supersampling. And that tech exists now, so \u2026 cool.\n\nIf your games were aimed at 20-series hardware, they're going to run great on this card.\n\nI didn't buy it for those games though. I bought this for a working machine which got an upgrade to its monitor. The old one _couldn't_ keep up, and this one can. Glad prices dropped when they did. (That said, I do play a couple of games that were bigger before 2020 than they are today and those play nicely. Under Linux, no less, since that's what this machine runs.)\n\nOh, if you're setting up a machine to be a SteamDeck's big brother, this isn't a bad card for that use. You can game on this thing at 1440p all day long, like I said, and if you wanted to run SteamOS on a machine, this card will work awesomely with it! Better than an equivalent Nvidia card actually\u2014FAR better than an equivalent Nvidia card, actually. Which is probably some hint of what I'll be doing with this card if I upgrade to something bigger for workstation use."

It's optimized entirely around noise and not performance. To list my own temps before and after setting my own fan curve:\n\nMax load: Ambient: 65C Junction: 79C (spikes up to 85C)\nMax load: Ambient: 52C Junction: 67C (with custom fan curve)\n\nSo yeah, a pretty large difference as you can see. My own fan curves are also pretty modest, with the max fan RPM staying around 50% to maintain those temps consistently.

While that setup got me through the years, it was starting to show its age on modern 3D applications, especially with the OpenGL being out of date.\n\nBefore pulling the trigger on the GPU upgrade, I was concerned that the GTX 1050 Ti wouldn't function with my CPU which is only \"rated\" to support PCI-E 2.0, and not 3.0, as many forums claimed. I was happy to do further research, and learn that they do in fact cooperate just fine! The only down side is that I may never see the full potential of this card until I upgrade my GPU, as my current one could act as a bottle-neck under high load (which I will never experience, since I play mostly older games anyways.)\n\nThe conclusion is that I am extremely happy with this upgrade, and I don't think I could have made a better choice given my current setup.\n\n* For the record, I have also upgraded my power supply from a 400W to a 600W, switched to SSD primary drive, went from 4GB to 8GB of DDR3 system RAM., and added 2 large fans."

I was suprised to see that games even an old game like Sly2 would play at all with integrated graphics; it has slow choppy parts; however using the 1050ti GPU speeds up the slow down spots and makes great game play: better than it was 18 years ago. The 1050 came out more than 6 years ago so you may think it outdated in 2022; I ASUS thinks so: the driver was updated in July 2022 and I think they would have wasted the resources on Updates for outdated hardware. When I built my pc a few years ago the price of graphics cards was through the roof, I planned to upgrade later, I was so happy to find such a well manufactured card at such a low price!\nThe only negative is the card card came in a box with just a two page manual, no CD, no posters, nothing else; but that is all I needed, I would have visited the website to download the latest driver anyway, and as for the books and ads who looks at those anyway?"

Keep in mind that you should check your motherboard or GPU specs and see if it supports PCIe 16, x16 or dual x8. Since this 1050 Ti is PCIe 3 it still works fine in a PCIe 2.0 slot.\n\nMy Specs:\n\nOS - Windows 10 Pro 64-bit\nMOBO - ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC. 970 PRO GAMING/AURA (Socket 942)CPU - AMD FX-8350 Vishera 32nm Technology\nGPU - 4095MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti\nRAM - GSkill 32.0GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 802MHz (11-11-11-28)\nDrive - Samsung SSD 870 QVO 2TB (SATA (SSD)\n\nThe MOBO is a few years old but you have no worries if your current setup supports PCI-E X16 slot.\n\nSuggestion is to run a GPU test on it with NovaBench and/or Unigine Heaven Benchmark apps. Another suggestion is to remove all of of your old graphic drivers before you install this new GPU card and then install the new drivers for this card and do a fresh install.\n\nI achieved up to 150 fps during bench marking with no hiccups. Great card - glad I got it. Cheers!"

It meets the minimum requirements for Windows Mixed Reality and will power a headset such as the Samsung Odyssey Plus at its lower settings running some of the older games. It will let you join the VR world to determine if you want to upgrade to a more sophisticated system without breaking the bank.\n\nOutside the VR world, the video card is a great addition to a desktop system designed for graphic rendering. It has one each; display port, HDMI and DVI ports (can power multiple monitors at the same time). It does not require a PCIe power adapter to run so it can be installed in a system with an older power supply. It fits nicely into a case; however, it does require two card slots to allow enough room for the cooling fan.\n\nYou will need to download the latest NVIDIA drivers to maximize the card's potential. It runs quiet, displays 4K and can run HDR if your monitor supports it."

Because I belive in trying every possible situation by troubleshooting the part before just sending it back and maybe the same thing happens. This card got here May 1st. At first I only had 1 desktop and two laptops. Oh and trust me, I even tried the laptops, I bought a e2mc to usb chord, (e2mc is the new smaller adaptors for solid state hard drives and wireless cards, and yes you can plug into that put your card on a riser) Basically I tried everything. On the first card, I bought from this company it didn't work. With anything! I feel like the day it came in was the day I woke up and stepped into the outer ring of hell. Anything involving this product turns into work wasted. Can I at least send it back to you guys so I can get this paperweight of a reminder of this off my desk?"

Most cards that have an output layout like this are fake and, seeing reviews from people saying it won't run DX11, I'm inclined to believe this isn't even a 6770 as those did run DX11. The listed clock speed is about 200mhz lower than the original cards which, at best, points to these being faulty cards flashed with a different BIOS to operate at a lower clock speed. HD 5770s and 6770s (same card with 2 names) also NEVER came with 4GB of VRAM.\n\nAgain, this points to this being a card with a fake BIOS. I've tested another faked GPU claiming to be a GTX 960 4GB and the card even reported itself as such to the computer. In actuality it was a GT640 with 1GB of VRAM. When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash. In other words KEEP SHOPPING!"

I have a 5900x paired with this 6900xt now with SAM enabled and I'm getting close to 200-350fps in most shooters and 150-200 fps in games such as Balders Gate 3 and other games that are more detail oriented.\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend having an AMD CPU and GPU to fully utilize every bit of this graphics card. The difference in FPS is close to 30-50 frames in most games.\n\nAlso the graphics card looks amazing in my pc. Incredibly slick and clean. I WOULD recommend to get some kind of anti sag bar to hold it up."

You're not going to want to run it without one.\n\nIt runs games insanely well. 16 GB of VRAM means you can run ultra textures in modern games pretty easily.\n\nIt runs suprisingly cool if your case has adequate airflow. The fans and gargantuan heatsink do an excellent job. You will need to adjust your fan curve a bit higher on demanding games, and the fans can be pretty loud, but that's too be expected when you're drawing so many watts.\n\nThere's also some decently noticeable coil whine once you start really drawing some watts in demanding titles. With an enclosed case, I generally tune it out after a couple minutes and forget about it, so it's not super loud. But it is there, if that bothers you. I can't really be too mad about it though, as many GPUs these days at this level of performance have issues with coil whine too. It's a lot of energy to handle.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend it for sure, if you can snatch it for $900 or lower, like I did. Especially now that it's at $800 at the time of writing this. Just beware that it can be on the louder end once you start pushing it. But most cards will be the same, honestly. I'm enjoying it."

I would recommend using a PCI arm bracket for a bit of support because it's heavy (heavier than my 5700XT at least). But in terms of power, I can run anything on 4k \"Ultra\" settings and frames won't drop from 80-90s. On 1440p it destroys any game. Make sure you have a fast monitor as well!\n\nThe only downside I can say is the horrible coil whine noise I have. This card needs a substantial amount of power and anything less than 750W will make the coil noise worse. Make sure you use separate power cables for the power that goes to the card and not a single one that splits in two. It will alleviate coil whine but won't make it go away. I have burn-tested this card several hours and still the coil is real. So my only critique is noise, other than that, great card and good price too!"

As of writing, others seem to have also gotten the deal, as it's out of stock.\n\nI got this for $899 (+tax), and based on nearly every other top card out there, and AMD's own website, I got this for a steal. AMD website lists their own 6900XT for $999.\n\nWith the awesome deal from XFX out of the way:\n\nThis is a BIG, HEAVY card. I knew from the getgo I'd need a support bracket, which I got. You will probably bend the PCIe port over time without support.\nAlso, you can see in the picture that this is a long card. Beware of that.\n\nAnother thing I wasn't completely aware of: Depending on your motherboard PCIe slot placement, you can't put anything directly below the card. I tried doing a dual GPU system with the 6600 and found that the clearance was less than half an inch. This is technically a triple slot card!\n\nA small annoyance as well: after a fair bit of google searching and posts, there doesn't seem to be a way to control/turn off the lights on the front. I don't mind but others may.\n\nAll in all, I'm supremely happy to have gotten a top 3 card for what appears to be BELOW MSRP. If it ever comes back in stock, definitely get it."

Can run games at 4k but you have to adjust the settings if you want steady 60 fps. but 1080 well over 144 fps. This is technically a 1440p card. There is a bug with playing fornite where the frame rate is a bit choppy due to an issue with epic. Amd has apparently check everything on their side. But all other games i have tried no issues. will update after I have had this card for a while.\n\n1 week update. this was my first AMD card. I did have some crashes on games like modern warfare/ cold war/ and the division 2. But after updating and tweaking settings the crashes are no longer happening. Update to the optional newest driver. I also used the auto undervolted option on amd software so the card use less power. that seemed to help. runs about 75 degrees Celsius in my case. I do not have the best fans in my case they produce barely enough airflow. As far a fornite goes if you turn all settings up to epic except ambient collusion (leave this on performace) and keep raytracing off then stay in the menu for 5 mins to let the shaders build the first time you play. The frame rate seems to smooth out properly. Every time you make changes to the effects setting or post processing give time for the shaders to update.\nSo all in all after tweaking settings and updating games the card is still running great on all my games. If you dont mind playing with settings and ray tracing does not matter to you. The 6700 is the better value if you can get it around that $379 price point which is the same cost as the cheapest 3060 at this time."

It replaced a pair of old GeForce 555s that gave up the ghost and had come out of my son's Alienware.\n\nOther reviewers have complained about the noise but so far it's completely silent, even with 3 fans. Of course the rig already has 7 other fans including 5 that are Thor's, a Noctua for the CPU, and the Corsair's own.

The workaround is, whenever you want to enter the BIOS setup, you\u2019ll need to move the monitor to an HDMI port on your PC prior to boot up.

Input lag seems better and switching in and out of FFXIV now takes less than 1 second instead of 5 to 7 though I would not know if that issue with the 1080 was due to the card, driver or some setting I flipped at some point. Turned the FPS down to 60 for now due to avoiding DSC which at 4K can make some text harder to see on any card. Depends on ones eyes somewhat.

I play Call of Duty: Warzone a lot and this card can maintain 4k 144hz pretty steadily through most game modes with DLSS turned on and no OC. Of course, this all requires a pretty powerful CPU as well but this review is about the card. I used to own a 3080ti FE that had trouble even with DLSS Ultra Performance on and a pretty significant OC. This card can handle APEX, Hunter: Call of the Wild, and Madden 22 at 4k with max settings with ease. I also stream from my gaming computer and I don't really notice any significant FPS drops when doing so. If you have the money, this card is worth it. I would recommend giving it 3-4 months if possible given that the 4000 series GPUs are going to hit the market and this card is around the same price as the 4090 is rumored to be.\n\nNote: This requires a lot of juice. I had to upgrade my PSU to the MSI A1000G to give this card some power wiggle. Again, make sure your case can handle the size of this card. It barely fit in my NZXT H510 mid-tower with a CPU water cooler attached. I had like 1.5 inches of room to spare to fit the power cables for the card. Also, if you have the H510 case, you cannot mount it to the bottom PCI slot. There is not enough room. Again, this card is massive. About 2.5 times the thickness of the 3080ti FE."

So when the price dropped to $1399 on the 3090 ti ftw3 Ultra it was a no-brainer for me. They moved the ram so in the same case my 3090 ti never goes above 65 degrees and gets even better performance, even with all settings now turned to max.\n\nThis thing is THICK! The cooler does it's job very well. They also got rid of the ugly red line that was on the evga 3080 ti, 3090, etc. It is a SOLID backplate and is overall built incredibly well. You likely don't even need a support or weird leash they gave :)\n\nDisregard the salty neckbeards on reddit and other social media....\nIf you want an upgrade and have solid cash flow in your life, this is an excellent choice now at the current price of $1399. You could wait for the 40 series, but at the time of this review we don't have any solid specs, dates, etc and it could be awhile before we see EVGA, ASUS, and other brands make their versions of the cards."

                    "text": "I see many users leaving low star reviews because they paid more than msrp for a GPU. I am not deducting any stars for that. This card is msrp around $1100 on MSI's website. I paid $1790 from a third party seller. My 1080 ti died and I needed something and you either pay an inflated price or wait who knows how long for a notify queue.\n\nThis card is big. It measured 12\" long. It is heavy and seems to be well built with a metal back plate. It came with a support bracket. I installed it but I don't know how much good it will do since I can flex it with my hand. My motherboard has the reinforced pcie slots so that helps too. It has 3 8 pin connections for power.\n\nAfter installing and firing up my pc I tried to download the dragon center software that is required to change the RGB lighting on the card. I went to the support section of the MSI website as directed by the included paperwork in the box. I downloaded the dragon center and it went through the installation process. Once complete nothing happened. I googled it and it is a common issue. I ended up having to install a Microsoft app called MSI Center. It installed properly and the good thing about it is that you can install just the software that you want. I only installed the mystic light software to be able to change the color of the RGB lights. I went through all the different options and ended up choosing the static lighting. It is way too bright. I have it on the lowest setting and it is still brighter than the lights on my motherboard, case fans and memory. Also turning it down to the lowest setting makes the MSI logo barely visible. I had read that people weren't impressed with the low quality RGB on this card. I agree. If you choose an option like having the lights scroll back and forth they look like they are stuttering instead of a smooth flow like on my Corsair Vengeance led ram. It is a bit ridiculous that I had to jump through so many hoops just to change the color of the lights.\n\nI was warned on a forum that my Seasonic Prime Titanium 850 PSU might have issues with this card and cause frequent crashes. There are a lot of people complaining of this. So far I have not had any crashing issues. I ran the Heaven benchmark stress test a couple of times without any issues. I also read that the 3000 series cards run too hot. The thermal limit on this one is 93 C. I got up to 87 C with Heaven. I played a game afterward and the card was still running pretty hot. I am not sure if the heat created during the Heaven benchmark was having a hard time dissipating because I played the same game again the next day and my temps never exceeded 48 to51C. Right now it is 23C at idle.\n\nThe fans are very quiet. I can run them at 70% and barely hear them. I set a custom fan curve in MSI Afterburner and one thing that is interesting is that you have to run the fans at a minimum of 30% with Afterburner. I never let my cards run in silent mode (fans off) so not a big deal to me.\n\nI can't offer much feedback on the performance of the card since I am still running an old I7 7700K CPU. It is definitely not enough CPU for a 3080. It looks like it is difficult to buy any pc components right now, not just GPU's. I am waiting until prices and stock get back to normal before buying a new CPU and motherboard. I opened quite a few games I have played recently to see what the frames per second were. Not much different than my 1080ti. I'm sure with an I9 10900 or better I would see a huge difference.\n\nThis seems to be a decent GPU. I was hoping to get my hands on an EVGA FTW3 but people in the notify queue are saying they have been waiting for a year or more. The third party prices on that model are over 2K. MSI and ASUS were my second choice so when I saw this at $1790 I figured this was probably the most reasonable deal right now. What a scam that these cards were supposed to be priced really low and you can't even find them in stock for how long now?\n\nUpdate 10/4/21\n\nI may have been wrong about the $1100 retail price on MSI's website. I can't even find pricing now. I must have seen it somewhere else.\n\nAfter initially setting my RGB colors with Mystic Light I cannot get it to work again. I don't plan on changing the color again so I am just leaving it alone. If you want to continually change your RGB setup you may have issues with this.\n\nMSI Afterburner has recorded a core clock speed of 2010MHz. The card is factory overclocked at 1830 so this is a nice bump since I haven't done any overclocking with it at all. Apparently Nvidia GPU boost will overclock these cards automatically as long as there is thermal headroom. My card is running at 23C at idle right now. The hottest it has got while gaming is 54C. Way cooler than my 1080 ti."

Front fans all have rgb, same of the gfx card and ram sticks.\nI run Mount and Blade: Bannerlord, and I get kind of tired of doing all the sieges so I start them and leave it running in the background and watch YouTube in the meantime with a set of 7 different tabs of videos I have queued to watch. Gpu use percentage can still reach a little high at borderline maxed out game settings, but temps have never went past 75c. And research said 70c is about the average temps for more higher end cards. It does heat up my room so I'd also save money on heating\nin the winter but it's still summer so I constantly have to have my AC running to counteract it. Fan sounds are a little noticable sometimes but not very often. You definitely don't hear it while wearing a noise cancelling headset. And let's be honest, you don't need a card this powerful unless you are playing games which, 9/10, would required a headset anyway.\nI paid roughly $850 for mine at the time and I would say it was well worth it especially since I've been wanting to upgrade for awhile and prices have settled enough to make upgrading a viable option."

They\u2019ve all I\u2019ve ever used. Best warranties and best RMA\u2019s which I\u2019ve dealt with a lot on my 1070 but evga always took care of it. Don\u2019t know what brand I\u2019ll use now. Sucks evga can\u2019t suck it up and just build them. Honestly don\u2019t get the throwing a fit then running away with the poor us attitude.."

I RMA'd it and got sent a replacement, where I was ASSURED that the GPU was completely fine. SAME THING KEPT HAPPENING WITH THE REPLACEMENT GPU. So I spent the next few months replacing LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE OTHER PART in my PC down to the nvme ssd I had, AND STILL same issue. Only now its WORSE and has locked my pc into a BSOD loop that won't even let me get to the login screen. I take the RTX 3080 ti out and replace it with my gtx 1080 and everything works FINE. Cannot believe I was sent a defective card TWICE and spent half a year stressed out and straight up lied to by evga.

My Nvidia driver was already new enough to see this card in my X570 build.\n\nThe EVGA X1 software ver 1.2.6 which was already installed on this PC - recognized the new GPU & advised an update to the firmware.\n\nThe X1 firmware updated without issue. You just need to wait for it to complete. I highly recommend using a UPS power supply, you do not want any interruptions during the update.\n\nYes 30 series GPUs run warmer than previous designs ... that is the price of a more powerful GPU. So, you want excellent air flow ... & not a tiny case &your case fans need to be moving plenty of air\n\nRoom Temp 68F [20C] ..... GPU die Max 60C @ 2040 MHz with a small OC setting in EVGA X1 software. This is an Open bench test & has been running like this for Over 12 hours. Cards fans @ 90%\n\nThat is a Delta T of 40C (die temp Rise, over room temp) - the case, fans & room temp you use can impact your results\n\nUsing an EVGA 850 T2 PSU with No Issues on a x570S MB & 5950X AMD 16 core CPU\n\nNot OC CPU or heavy loads on CPU -- pulls 600-650W, with the 3080Ti FTW3 Ultra under Full load\n\nThe only Con in the whole process .... Was the shipping from Amazon. Package was not shipped for 2 day delivery - Amazon choose to ship ground 5 days? no idea why with a Prime account.\n\nThe Bigger issue ... did someone try to open this box ? It was destroyed! Crushed! Torn Open in Spots!\n\nI made the UPS driver wait while I inspected my package contents - Box was destroyed & partially re-taped in few spots .... What in the World happened to that box, was my first thought.\n\n..... the outer shipping box was heavily damaged --> crushed & corners seams torn open in several places\n\n... looks like someone might have tried to remove the contents ??\n\n... The EVGA thin \"retail box\" (with the Pictures of GPU) only had minimal damage ... torn where it looks like someone tried to open? & 1 corner of the box had a Small dent.\n\n..... The inner retail \"heavy box\" inside the retail package was not damaged at All ? This does not equate to the destroyed shipping box. I do not believe this damage was from the automated convener system UPS uses\n\n... again almost like someone tried to open the shipping Box & retail package .... the EVGA factory seals were still intact. So, I took possession of the package from UPS & signed for this EVGA 3080Ti FTW3 Ultra"

The 1080 Ti is still a beast of a card make no mistakes, but I couldn't pass this up at this price.\n\nThis card is large. I have my build in a Coolermaster HAF XB EVO and in order to fit this card, I had to move my fans to the outside of my case, leaving only the 240mm radiator inside.\n\nLet me start off by saying, in this day and age, I'm not looking to game on the bleeding edge of graphics. My happy gaming spot is ultra graphics, 1080p @ 60hz (Fps) if I can game at these settings and not see a single dip in my frames, I'm a happy camper.\n\n\"But isn't this overkill for those settings?\" Absolutely! I bought this card so that I could undervolt and underclock it. I have a custom curve set in MSI afterburner to limit my clock speek to 1710 mhz @ .775 volts and have capped my power limit 65% of max.\n\nPeople say that these cards pull a lot of power and run hot, but at these settings, in brief stress tests I'm seeing 60c on the hotspots/mem with the power ceiling hitting the 65% @ 288w max pulled @.775volts\n\nIn everyday long gaming utilization I see it top out around 190w at these settings. Hot spots and mem temps maxing around 54c (I have two low flow 120s set up to blow directly on this card so the fans never even have to kick on)\n\nMy reason for purchasing this card and not a lower tier card for playing at these settings can be summed up by the following analogy:\n\nI'd rather buy a Ferrari and cruise around in it at 70mph, knowing that if push comes to shove I can drive it at 140 every once in a while just for fun, than buy a Prius that I'm red-lining @80mph just to get where I'm going on time, worrying that any day it will crap out on me."

But despite the quality air cooler it inevitably runs hot due to the cards high power consumption. They can only go so far with a air cooler with a powerful card like this one. I managed to drop 7 degrees across the board by just replacing the thermal pasta and adding thermal pads to the back plate.. evga should of done that from the factory imo. It's fun to disassemble regardless so no big deal for me personally.

I wasn't aware of how used to 15-25fps I was until I upgraded with this GPU. I checked the prices a couple of years ago and laughed as I walked away. \"I built my computer for nearly that much.\" I thought.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, when I bought this unit, the price was well under MSRP. Now it seems that the price is up by at least 25%. This is a very functional GPU and in my case, was a tremendous upgrade from my previous card. However, new buyers should be wary of the fluctuating prices and not pay much, if any over the product's MSRP.\n\nAs for the performance: This newfound power of double-digit frames per second allowed me to play with the settings on multiple games and see the resulting clarity. I demand a great deal when it comes to multitasking with my GPU. I will certainly have fifty windows of Chrome and two of Excel open while any game is running. Very seldom do I get to JUST game. That being said, I still get 18-25 fps on GTA5 on max settings, but I found a mix of ultra and very high settings that give me 55+fps in 4K windowed mode. If these programs take too long to minimize, I also downgrade graphics and this was a good combo. Tiny Tina's Wonderland gave 25-35fps on max settings, but low texture quality and ultra texture rendering cranked that up to 55+fps. The \"low quality\" textures still allow you to see splinters in wooden armor as long as they load in quickly.\n\nAnyone seeing these numbers would say the same thing: \"You're limited by your CPU\" This is absolutely true, but I assume many people out there were looking for a good card to maximize their current CPU. If you're building new, then you'll see far better numbers than myself just because you'll likely have a much more powerful CPU. For now, at least I can easily max out my 4K 60hz while not changing anything else about my machine or habits.\n\nAt the time (and price) of purchase, this was a great upgrade to my older PC."

While this card is a tad expensive it is not priced at the ridiculously insane prices of the middle to high end gaming video cards in 2022. This GPU has done the job of letting me go anywhere on the internet without video lag.\n\nI had a more expensive NVIDIA GPU in my system with otherwise state of the art hardware. The newest most power Ryzen 9 \\ 5900 CPU, fast memory and a 750 watt power supply. The NVIDIA GPU ran like hot garbage on my Ubuntu system. Ubuntu has a nasty sepia color scheme that saturates the entire OS and everything in it. It is not only ugly but painful to look at due to my vision issues.\n\nI did not know for sure at the time but, I hoped a new video card from someone other than NVIDIA might perform better. Turns out this AMD designed GPU got rid of the nasty sepia tint. This video card creates a simple un-tinted OS that is a pleasure to use. The card is not BIG and uses only the power supplied by the GPU slot.\n\nThe card has some energy saver garbage installed that turns the card off if you power down your monitor. I took a star off for the energy saver mess. There really are no other issues. This is a great card to use on a Linux\\Ubuntu system that is not used for hard core gaming."

I counted on Amazon's liberal return policy and took the gamble. I changed to the low-profile bracket, ditching the VGA port and downloaded the latest NVIDIA drivers. I'm pleased to say this card and its 4GB are running two 27\" monitors essentially straight from setup. I don't know why other reviews can't run more than one monitor, but I also don't know their level of expertise. I come from that 90's & 2000's group that went and got bits and pieces at Fry's and popped them into the computer case, learning by trial and error. I'm no expert, but I can get by.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing in the box other than the card and the low-profile bracket. You'll have to go to NVIDIA dot com to get your drivers. I disk or leaflet with minimal instructions wouldn't go amiss with some of the purchasers.\n\nAnyway...good video card, reliable (so far) after four weeks, and I'm happy with my purchase."

And it is fine for a computer that is used for surfing, basic desktop work, etc. But once you want to watch a full-screen 4K video it struggles. Badly.\nTo be fair here, the 10-series were not built for 4K. But it needs to be said: it is one thing to do static work on 4K resolutions; once you go to a high-quality media display this is not the card you are looking for.\n\nSo this card does what it needs to do - and it will perform fine for most things in resolutions under 4k. It is affordable and available. But don't buy this one for high-quality gaming or intensive video or animation work."

It also consumed a ton of power (250W). The last straw was when I bought Doom Eternal, which, at launch, supported the 280x reasonably well, but the latest patch made the graphics glitch out. So, fed up, I went looking for a replacement. While everything is still hugely overpriced, I found that the RX 6600 XT was generally considered one of the best bang-per-buck cards out right now and it's only rated at 160W. It's also a physically much shorter card. Reviews say its 2-3 times faster than my old card, but they really understate it.\n\nMaybe it's only 2-3x faster in artificial benchmarks at low resolutions or something, but I can now play Doom Eternal at High or Ultra detail WITH raytracing at 1080P at a solid 60fps. My old card had graphical glitches and could barely play it at 720p low detail and ~30fps. I think the core grunt of the GPU is not much more than 2-3x my old card, but the addition of tons of newer features, newer drivers, and more than twice the VRAM allows it to perform an order of magnitude better in more recent games. It also has true DX12 support (the r9 card did not) so everything will run on it regardless of performance.\n\nIt's quieter, runs cooler, can run the latest games maxed out (at 1080p anyway) and has yet to give me any trouble, but I did just get it yesterday... We'll see how reliable it in the coming months. I don't plan to mine or anything, so hopefully it will last me years, since I can't justify spending hundreds on a video card very often."

This might change when the RTX 40 series cards launch, but atm, AMD cards are a way better value.\n\nRunning 3d Mark Time Spy, the card reached the advertised 2000Mhz Memory Clock with an average of 1989Mhz. The clock frequency had an average 2509Mhz which is right in between the advertised gaming and boost clock, and a below 2000rpm, the fans were tolerable when playing with speakers.\n\nThe one con is when the fans hit 2000+ rpm they start to rattle. By default the fans would ramp up to 2300 rpm while bench testing.\n\nThis was very easy to fix, by using AMD's software you can limit the max fan speed to 70% which will cap the fan rpm just below 2000. The side effect is that the stock gpu ran about 2 degrees hotter, which is still below 70c and gives some room for overclocking.

Though I would suggest the Non XT card if you don't wanna go this high, as well as a lower end CPU. Should last you up until the next gen comes out either way."

It's very quick to setup, the magnet isn't too strong so you can still slide it into the perfect spot, or remove it with ease. It has nice rubber stoppers on each end, although I think the one improvement I would make is a slightly taller one on the GPU side, or any improvement that may prevent any odd angled GPU shroud from touching the metal. MSI just happens to make their Gaming Z/X Trio card's shrouds a pain to find a good spot on.\n\nThere is one notable downside to this design, if your case doesn't have a PSU shroud at the bottom, you have bottom intake fans, or for some other obstruction or large distance from the motherboard to the bottom of the case, then this won't likely work.\n\nAlso would suggest removing it if transporting your PC in any mildly rough manner. Many of us try to take good care with our PC's, however as it's not solidly secured, a bumpy enough road or something could knock it loose(carefully carrying around your case won't likely be an issue though)."

You could probably make something out of a stick or some other material and not have to pay for this price. I could have measured the height i needed but i bought both this stick and the graphics card at around the same time so i did not have it physically to measure. Oh well, that part's my undoing and it still works as a sag holder anyway (but with similar builds as i have above, i recommend getting something smaller but adjustable just in case).\n\nBe mindful of the graphics card's surface where this stick would support. My card has uneven surfaces as part of the EVGA aesthetic design and only on certain parts of it can this stick be placed under while it is in its shortest config. If not checking, it might cause the card to bend upwards thus damaging the PCI-E connector and slot which defeats the purpose of this product.\n\nThe cushioning pad on the stick's tip is a nice touch for keeping in contact with the surface of the GPU, just don't expect this to be a vibration dampener. The magnet on the bottom helps in stability as it stand on the PSU shroud.\n\nWill probably fit better in other taller cases or slightly thinner GPUs.\n\n---Weird paint prints---\nUpon unboxing, the surface of the barrel/stick seemed to have imperfections on it. It looked like paint imperfections or paint or polishing error as some of it could be mistaken as partial fingerprints from paint or oil that then solidified after manufacturing. I thought if it wasn't paint, oil or lubrication, it could be harmful chemicals. I thought of repackagin and returning it but i just scrubbed it with disinfecting wipes which cleared the weird marks."

So a RTX card was necessary.\n\nFor games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.\n\nBut anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance. The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical. I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess. (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)\n\nAll I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.\n\nIt arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it. The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison. Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.\n\nEspecially if Amazon finances it for me lol. Anyone need a spare kidney?"

The graphics card I had in it was an AMD Powercolor R9 380x (which had 2 x 6 pin connecter). This was a decent card back in the day, but it was time to replace. The R4 has PCIe 3.0. I decided to stay with AMD on this particular PC and chose the RX 6600. I chose this based on price & performance. The RX 6600 is PCIe 4.0 but runs extremely well on PCIe 3.0 and you really on lose about 1% of the card's full potential. I also gained Ray Tracing and the most recent version of Direct X. Another big boost was going from 4GB of GDDR 5 up to 8GB of GDDR 6. This new RX6600 was auto recognized by my system as Free Sync Premium. (I have an ASUS TUF Gaming 27\" VG279QL1A). I'm running at 1920 x 1080 165Hz and have other options of 120Hz and 144Hz. This RX 6600 handles it all flawlessly.\nAnyway, I included two pictures of the GPU-Z showing a screenshot of my old card to the new one. I am extremely pleased with this graphics card. While my new R12 has the Nvidia 3080Ti, PowerColor has been my choice of AMD graphics on my R4 since I got it, and I will stay with them. The RX 6600 only needs (1) 8-pin connecter and of course, uses less power than the old R9 380x. The card is smooth, quiet and plays the games I enjoy... mainly FPS like the Call of Duty series and the Battlefield series. Other features on the new RX 6600 are listed here:\n\nAMD RDNA 2 Architecture\nPCIe 4.0 Support\nHDMI 2.1 VRR\nRadeon Anti-Lag\nDirectX 12 Ultimate\nDirectX Raytracing (DXR)\nRadeon Image Sharpening\nAMD FidelityFX Super Resolution\nAMD Infinity Cache"

From low-spec games like CS:GO and Valorant, to graphically intense games like Cyberpunk 2077, this card can run just about anything at high - max settings at 1080p. Especially during the current condition of GPU market, $245 for a card like this is a deal you cannot pass up.\n\nThe card performs great. From raw power to thermals, it performs very well. It can run Triple-A titles at medium-high settings with ease, and it runs them efficiently. No matter how graphically intense a game is, this card always manages to maintain temps under 65\u00b0C.\n\nIn conclusion, this card is perfect for gamers who just want to play every title on a budget. If you want to run major titles but you're not looking to spend too much on a GPU, this card is for you. This card gets the job done, and it does it very well at a fair cost."

But I decided to give Aorus \"Gigabyte\" a chance and I was ultimately very disappointed with their software. RGB Fusion in particular will frequently cause BSOD \"Blue Screen Of Death\", when turning off the computer. It really sucks that you pay hundreds of dollars for a product with software thats corrupted, and is the only way of controlling the RGB. On a side note I spent over 4 hours trying to get my graphics card to get re recognized by RGB fision .... not fun. Anyway the graphic card runs games fine can't fault it in that category.\n\nRe: I upgraded my pc and replaced the msi motherboard I was using with a new x670 gigabyte board and haven't had problems with RGB fusion since. I have however had problems with gigabyte control center OC profiles which can cause BSOD on cinebench but that's untimely unrelated to the graphics card."

But the GPU did arrive OK and boxed up nicely. Now not sure if this was a defective card or not but I finally got it working in my system and decided to keep it. With the bad commits about Gigabyte power supplies just not sure if Gigabyte is just making poor quality equipment now.\n\n1 Plugged card in \u2013 No Video - Checked all power cables and power supply all good\n2 Changed from Display port to center HDMI port and got video. If I tighten the card in my pc case, card will NOT work again.\n3 Left card just hanging in my PCIe port not screwed in and got video with HDMI and Display Ports now. Short in my system board? NO, not my equipment.\n4 Was NOT able to seat card completely in the PCIe slot but was able to screw in card to pc case to hold inplace, OK. Card boots up slowly flipping displays between the two monitors and goes to windows OK now\n5 Slow bad graphics in simple games like Start Craft2. 21 FPS unplayable. Ran the ASUS expert software and that seem to have fix the problem now. Getting 82 FPS in Star Craft with all setting on Extreme settings now. Card runs at 58 degrees to no higher than 60 degrees.\n\nI bought this card because the older 1070 Nvidia was having problems keeping up with games and RTX was just not there. Intel 10900, 64GB RAM, 1TB 970 Evo Plus, ASUS x299 board. Should be able to play any game I want to play.

I however would suggest making sure you have a good setup for heat disperse, cause this card can get hot which makes OC harder especially if you have a 10th gen or above processor. I would suggest making time to benchmark it also before you attempt OC it's powerful but it's not a 3090. It's a good product though overall and pretty stable minus the heat issue."

To be clear, I don't game, I don't render video, I just trade stocks on this PC. I already had 4 monitors, but between utilizing multiple timeframes on the same ticker to make decisions, multiple order entry boxes(Level II), time and sale (tape) and then the desire to have more windows from my scanners up and more tickers to just be able to watch outside of the ones I'm already in, I felt I'd need to add a couple more monitors. Right now I'm only running 1 more hdmi out to a TV and I have a scanner running on it full screen, which works great, as opposed to what I was doing before, which was minimizing a browser which would block one of my trading screens when I pulled it back up. I thought when I first started trading that 2-3 monitors would be all I'd need. I could not have been more naive. Every bit of information you could possibly have, I'm willing to take. I'm a bit annoyed that I asked on here whether I could add another card. I actually got responses saying they didn't think so, meanwhile I KNOW I've seen other traders with 6-8 monitors, and having already a 3060ti in my build, I know in Zotac's Firestorm I've seen where the software allows you to click between up to 4 graphics cards in order to overclock them differently. So despite the responses received and using some logic to determine this was ok, I decided to go ahead and buy the 1660 and figured I'd return it if it didn't work out. I'm glad I did. My bequiet PSU actually had another set of 8pin outs that I wasn't using. My 3060ti was only using one, so I was able to use the other for the 1660. Worked like a charm! When I booted up my computer after install, it did take a little longer to boot up, but once I got home screen, I opened up Nvidia settings, I went straight to 'setup multiple monitors' and just fiddled around with things and I must say, nice and smooth. The 1660 is not as bad as I thought it would be. Actually almost just as clear, but the 3060ti is clearly a few notches above. It's just smoother and snappier. You can tell this with just the mouse movement alone and how it feels in your hand. This is partly bc my first pci slot is getting pci 4.0 and the 1660's pci slot is only able to offer 3.0 come to find out. All in all the 1660 was not intended to be some high definition card in the first place. At least not for my build. Overall, I'm happy.\n\nSo now I'm running:\nAsRock x570 Taichi Razer Edition\nRyzen 9 5900x overclocked to 4.4ghz at 1.25v\nNoctua Nh-U12a CPU Cooler\nCorsair Vengeance LPX 32x2 3800mhz cl18 (I could not get even 3600mhz using 4x16, which is what I really wanted bc it looks better imo)\nZotac RTX 3060ti (you do not need more than this for trading)\nZotac GTX 1660\nBeQuiet Straight Power 850w Platinum PSU (I'm pulling about 265w total with both cards in, but that's with only 1 hdmi out being used on this new graphics card. I could end up pulling more one I use some of the display ports)\nArctic F14 (2 in front, 1 in rear)\nArctic P14 (2 in top) - The system is nice and quiet :)\n\nI have a monitor sitting in storage that I think I'm going to try in order to arrange my screens.\n\nWill report back if anything changes..."

In between I did a deep cleaning of my case vacuuming the dust. Card is quiet as in the first day, no heating issues and running rock solid. I think in all this time I can count on the fingers from one hand how many times I had to hard reboot the machine due to issues (not sure if they were graphic card related). Also I'm still amazed that I paid less than what it is asked today. Guess I will keep the card until prices come to 'normal'...\n\nI was saving and aiming for a RX470 but I was not ready to pay over $200 for it and then I was not ready to pay $250 (if you can find one today) for a 6GB GTX 1060 either... so I had to settle for this one.\nThis is the stepchild of Nvidia's 10 Series (Pascal), which compared to 6Gb version has obviously half the RAM, 1152CudA cores vs 1280, and 72 TAUs vs 80, same base frequency 1506MHz and same TPD 120W. I think this card should have been named \"GTX 1060 LE\"!\nReceived the card in the original box with just my address printed in a corner, dropped by the door! Wow - Amazon, did you really shipped a $200 item in original box so everyone can see what is waiting at my door?!?\n-- CONTENT & INITIAL SETUP --\nThe box content it is plain simple: video card, no cables or drivers cd! I guess to keep the costs low or because there will be people asking \"why a CD nowadays when I use only USB drives!?\". I'm buying a video card, I want it to be as cheap as possible! I will use my internet connection to download needed and latest drivers (if they have made a CD/USB drive I bet it will not be latest drivers and you will still head out to official nVidia site!). Some people complained because they had no internet connection and could not download the driver! Really?!? In this case this card will use some generic drivers and since you don't have an internet connection I assume you have a 800x600 CRT monitor and it will work! (just jk...)\nI replaced my aged GTX 650 with this one and restart the computer, then installed the driver and ready to roll. Used GPU-Z to monitor and started War Thunder, set graphics on \"Cinema\" and AA to 8x and went on to some quick dog fights :) - sorry APA, it is not about animals but war planes!\nI used to get about 60FPS with old card and settings were on \"medium\", now I'm getting about 75FPS on average but the image it is really \"Cinema\". I checked the max temp and it was 82C which seemed a bit on the high side to me, but the good part is the video card fan was pretty quiet @82. Then I read a review where someone used EVGA Precision to control the card, I tried that but it was asking me for an account and EVGA product, so a no go, but on Zotac's website I found their FireStorm utility -> small (just one exe file), fast and simple to use!\n-- PERFORMANCE --\nI tested performance on my computer with AMD FX8320 on ASUS m5A99X EVO board with 16Gb RAM running Windows 10 (64bit) and I used Geeks Furmark at 1080p with AA set at 8X and ran it for 15 minutes to get an average of 35 FPS (minimum 29FPS). My old card was getting about 16FPS with minimum anti-aliasing.\nThen from FireStorm monitoring (card's default settings) I found that\n* GPU Core Clock: min 139, max 1911\n* GPU Memory Clock: min 202.5, max 2003.4\n* GPU Temp: min 27C, max.83C\n* Fan Speed: 50%(~1500rpm) - 75% (~2250rpm)\nAt idle GPU temp is around 36C with fan speed at 50%.\nIn FireStorm by default max GPU temp target it is set at 82C; I guess if I'm not happy with that I can lower it and fan speed will go past 75% (more noise).\n-- CONCLUSION --\nI think Zotac did a fine job with this small factor (mini) card trying to keep the price low; You need to register the product on their website for warranty. The only concern you may have is the \"only 3Gb RAM\" for the future. If this card would have 4Gb I think it would be a no-brainer over Rx 470 even RX 480 w/ 4Gb. Excellent Performance/power ratio. Personally I'm happy with the performance and I plan to hold onto it for at least 2 years. If you plan to use more than 1440p I'd suggest to look a bit higher. Price wise, if you can find Rx470 for $150, RX480 (4Gb) for $200 and GTX 1060 (6Gb) for $250 I think this card should be priced around $180."

Pull the old card, drop in the new one and hook up the PCIE power cable. I highly recommend that you use at least a 650 or 750 watt supply. I had a Corsair 750 watt supply on my parts shelf that I installed at the same time and when I fired the system up, I was impressed that I didn\u2019t hear a lot of fan noise.\n\nI like to use the official Nvidia drivers since they usually have better management utilities and better performance. After setting the system to use the \u201cmulti-user.target\u201d, I followed their installation procedure to blacklist the nouveau kernel modules and installed their drivers.\n\nAfter rebooting, the system went back to the default \u201cgraphical.target\u201d and things just worked from there on.\n\nI did some testing with Kerbel on Steam and the display was crisp, clean and had a decent frame rate. I didn\u2019t notice any extra fan noise and verified that the card continued to run cool. The two large fans do a nice job moving air while making minimal noise.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m pretty impressed with the card.

They've been profitable over the last month, once I got them set up right and configured where they are happy.\n\nI noticed they are a lot more finicky than my ASUS GTX 1060 3G cards. Those I slapped in, and away they went. I spent a couple days messing with these before I finally figured 2 things out: First was that you are never going to get the NVidia GTX drivers to install until you get Windows Device Manager to see both cards with the default VGA drivers installed and working. Second, after screwing around for hours and hours, I found that the one card would not work as Master in PCIe Slot 0, no matter what I did. It would work fine as a slave in any other slot. But even though the system saw the card in the Master slot, and it would bring Windows up on the default video driver, it kept bombing on the NVidia driver installation.\n\nOnce I got the right cards in the right slots. and got Windows to detect both cards as working with the default VGA drivers, I was able to successfully install the NVidia drivers. And while the system has been stable, for the most part, minus my monkeying with clock speeds, I still have some flaky stuff with the one card. that will only work as the slave. At default settings it's core clock insists on running about 40% slower than it's counterpart. Trying to overclock just that card to get it near the other one usually results in a core shutdown before it gets within even 10%. There is a big gap in the memory clock speeds as well and again the card will shut down before it lets me get the frequency anywhere near the other card's.\n\nThe differences in the clock speeds is born out in the hashing results of the two cards. The Master consistently returns 30-40% better rates and more accepted results.\n\nBut the Slave card does work, so I didn't see fit to return it. Heck it might be better to sell it used and get twice what I paid for it in return. But for right now the cards are both making money, so I'm happy to leave well enough alone.\n\nUpdate 1 May 18 - The card I was having problems with got worse. A few weeks after the Amazon return period was over, it had a bearing start grinding away. I looked into getting it replaced under warranty and found out that Zotac requires you register the card after purchase which I neglected to do. That wasn't that big a deal for me but be aware of that, I didn't really want to send it in and not have a card in the rig for god knows how many weeks, especially when I have a couple spare fans I can plunder out of some ancient GPUs I have lying around the house in case the failure becomes catastrophic. I'd call this purchase 2 1/2 stars now, but since the 2nd card has performed well I will keep the 3 stars for now."

Fortunately Dell has an innovative little attachment that lets you add 2 more.\n\nIt was the Nvida software that held me up. Not being a fan of that 'Experience' I just wanted the drivers and after downloading the game ready drivers it kept telling me it couldn't install in my version of windows10. Which was a first for me. Ultimately I was able to install the 'studio' drivers by installing on a peripheral drive. The card itself can now play games like Red Dead Redemption at Ultimate settings without a hitch.

This one though, my first GPU upgrade since pre-pandemic, is really on the line. It is possible I do not know what I am talking about and that all the cards coming out now are power-hungry behemoths, but based on the fact that I had to dig out auxiliary power cables for my modular (650W) PSU and remove a case fan to get this thing in...\n\nI also take issue, as a multi-monitor user, with its weird spread of 1 HDMI + 3 DisplayPort. Maybe that's standard now? I have been living under a COVID-shaped rock. But it works! (Although for some reason it makes the middle DisplayPort the primary monitor...)\n\nOn the positive side though, the card works just fine for gaming. It's quiet (although I also run MSI Afterburner), runs whatever I throw at it at 1080p without a hiccup, and enables ray tracing which for me is a big upgrade. I really wish the card was a little smaller and used a little less power, but-- I finally got a new video card!"

The moment it came and I opened it I was amazed with the build quality. It was mostly all metal and compared to the quality on my 2080 Super Strix this was better in every way! Additionally this card was AMAZING with thermals. Even with Red Dead Redemption cranked it kept a steady 60-65 degree range. With that it kept those frames up to.

Because I belive in trying every possible situation by troubleshooting the part before just sending it back and maybe the same thing happens. This card got here May 1st. At first I only had 1 desktop and two laptops. Oh and trust me, I even tried the laptops, I bought a e2mc to usb chord, (e2mc is the new smaller adaptors for solid state hard drives and wireless cards, and yes you can plug into that put your card on a riser) Basically I tried everything. On the first card, I bought from this company it didn't work. With anything! I feel like the day it came in was the day I woke up and stepped into the outer ring of hell. Anything involving this product turns into work wasted. Can I at least send it back to you guys so I can get this paperweight of a reminder of this off my desk?"

Most cards that have an output layout like this are fake and, seeing reviews from people saying it won't run DX11, I'm inclined to believe this isn't even a 6770 as those did run DX11. The listed clock speed is about 200mhz lower than the original cards which, at best, points to these being faulty cards flashed with a different BIOS to operate at a lower clock speed. HD 5770s and 6770s (same card with 2 names) also NEVER came with 4GB of VRAM.\n\nAgain, this points to this being a card with a fake BIOS. I've tested another faked GPU claiming to be a GTX 960 4GB and the card even reported itself as such to the computer. In actuality it was a GT640 with 1GB of VRAM. When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash. In other words KEEP SHOPPING!"

I have it paired with a R7 5800X (OC) and 32GB DDR4-3200. Next gen definitely won't be seeing me. I won't be needing anything for a few good years and I'm glad I'm not out there gambling on the future of the market anymore, especially with the way the world is looking currently. The build quality is amazing. Metal everywhere, no plastic, and it looks great. I DO have a couple gripes with the card though, and I'll point them out below:\n\n1. No Support Bracket In-Box: This is a premium product. It's definitely priced as such ($770 before tax), and it's an extremely big card. It's long, it's thick, and it's pretty heavy due to all the metal. There's no way in hell this card WON'T sag. I'm talking PRISON sag. How the hell can you package the 6900XT variant with a bracket but not this one, when they use the exact same cooler (if I recall correctly). Even if they don't by some chance, you still made the damn thing so you KNOW it needs support badly. I had to create a makeshift support stand out of toilet paper roll cores and masking tape, and it looks pretty stupid but it works. After spending over $820 in total for a GPU, it's a kick in the balls to have to dip again to get a bracket. You guys are wrong for not including your own bracket.\n\n2. Coil Whine: First time in my life I've had a card with coil whine, and I've had a few. Luckily it's not loud. When the side panel is on I can't hear it, and my desktop sits on top of my desk right next to me, but it's there. I hear it when I remove the side panel while it's on running demanding games. I hear it pretty clearly. It's annoying as hell lol. Now I see why people go crazy over it. Thankfully like I said mines can't penetrate the side panel so I'm right as rain.\n\n3. Connector Placement: This is the first GPU I've ever seen where the PCIe cables go in upside down. I've never seen this before and it threw off my cable management completely. I had to twist my cables in a way they weren't meant to twist so that they could go in upside down and now it looks ugly and hits the glass panel while routing to the left. You can feel the tension in the cables. I absolutely hate it, but with performance like this you get over things pretty quickly lol.\n\nIt replaced my Sapphire 5700XT Nitro+, which was still an utter beast even with today's games, and the performance leap is nothing short of enormous. Now I have a great card as a backup and an excellent card slotted in. I wanted the Nitro+ version of the 6800XT but the prices are goofy as hell. This is my first PowerColor product and so far I must say, the quality feels like the stuff I'm used to with Sapphire. Not quite as high, but a very close second."

Haven\u2019t tried it a 4K yet but will update. Now the down side, the ray tracing is unfortunately lacking, especially in full path traced games like Minecraft RTX that averages of 20 FPS, it does okay for ray tracing for the new call of duty games but too much of an impact for competitive gaming, great for the campaign though. Additionally it lacks dlss or some kind of competitor to boost the frame rate at high resolutions like the nvida cards, however it\u2019s not as important as only a small number of games support it.\n\nFinal gripe is it is huge it is a full 3 pcie slots high and almost didn\u2019t fit in my case because it is extremely long length, it fit in my lian li tu-150 but I wouldn\u2019t recommend putting it in one\n\nTLDR: amazing card for high frame rate modern AAA gaming, however leaves something to be desired for ray tracing profomance, also no dlss competitor and the card is massive"

The card is somewhat noisy in general once the fans go around 50 percent so adjust the fan curve to your liking in the radeon software. I use the RSR/FSR 2.0 to really get the most out of this card and personally it's working out pretty well.\n\nHowever the Rx 6600 line of cards should have only been $250 MSRP at most; with the 6600XT being $280-300 like the previous 5600XT was. The performance improvements are not worth another $50 from what the 5600XT was offering and that card was already a disaster at launch from how AMD scrambled to get that one released.

It's tempting to say, blast the fans to get a higher overclock, but I promise you, the noise is not worth a marginal performance boost. Besides, you can still get about a 100-200MHz overclock without putting the fan past 50%, hell, you can do it at 40% or lower. In fact, out of the box, the fan is set to be very quiet while the voltage curve is maxed out. And yes, out of the box, the core temps will reach over 100 degrees (the junction temp). So word of advice, LOWER THE DAMN VOLTAGE. This will take some tweaking, and you must enable overclocking, but lower voltage will not only make it run at lower temps and higher clock speeds, but it will also significantly reduce coil whine, which you are very likely to hear at 1.15v.\n\nSecond, ngl, this is stupid expensive. If you can't justify spending $800 on a graphics card, don't do it. Just get the 6700 or 6750xt or whatever that is more affordable. The performance difference is like 5-15% difference depending on the game.\n\nLast, this thing performs extremely well. I also bought a 4k 120hz oled tv to use as my main monitor and I didn't expect to be able to play 4k @ 120hz, but it's more than doable with this card depending on the game and settings of course. You will still get the hitching/stutters that lower performance cards get when you look around too fast on many games. Stuttering, like what happens in UE4 games is a result of clutter and high resolution textures and models. You won't see the same type of stuttering on older games (like the Witcher 3, Borderlands 2, etc.) so much because they just simply don't have as much clutter, or high resolution textures/models, so everything in the scene will easily load into VRAM or cache (or whatever it is that is slow) before a frame renders at 120fps. Performance is not guaranteed. However, I still was pretty shocked the performance I saw with this card, it definitely performs better than I expected.\n\ntl;dr\nLower the voltage, out of the box the curve is maxed out and the card gets HOT and coil whine will be noticeable. Only buy if the cost is not an issue, or you need it for a specific reason (like you are a game dev or researcher). And finally, it performs like a dream, but it's not perfect because nothing is."

It does make a bit of coil noise though. It's not too bad as long as you're wearing headphones you won't hear it at all. If you game with speakers at very low volume it might be a bit of an issue for you. It was not a dealbreaker for me, i use headphones and I could hear absolutely nothing even with no volume on in the headphones.\n\nThis card is incredibly well built though and everything I hear about XFX as a company is very positive, I hear they really stand behind their products. If I you are in the market for 6800xt I definitely reccomend this. I ultimately chose to go with an RTX 3080 though for the same price, because I think at the same price you get alot more for your money with the 3080 (raytracing and DLSS (which is definitely better than FSR 2.0).\n\nAssuming you have a power supply that can power the 3080, because it consumes like 100 more watts than this 6800xt, this 6800xt only consumed like 255 watts according to all the monitoring software I used (afterburner, AMD Adrenalin, GPU-Z) which is fantastic, while my 3080 (ASUS TUF Gaming 3080 12gb) sucks down between 355 - 370 watts which is a lot, so I needed to upgrade my power supply, I had a 650 seasonic focus gold and it was running the 3080, but I don't want to push my PSU to the limit like that so I got a 1000 watt EVGA supernova to power that. Now with this XFX 6800xt at 255 watts on the otherhand, the 650 will power it no problem at all. The card can be cranked up to like 270 watts for overclocking.\n\nOverall after owning this card for a while I think it's a great card, and that XFX is great brand, I trust them to make solid quality products."

The only problem with the 900d and it\u2019s obsolete design is it\u2019s difficult to screw down these 4.5\u201d wide cards. A magnetic flex bit holder is highly recommend for this task. Due to the design of this card, it was almost impossible to screw the card down, whereas I didn\u2019t have a whole lot of trouble screwing down an EVGA FTW3 card.\n\nThe 6800xt was the card I wanted all along, but I ended up getting a 3070 because that\u2019s what I was able to find in early 2021. I wasn\u2019t willing to pay the post tariff prices for the 6800xt. Then I used the Step-up program to get a 3080.\n\nAt lower a res like 1080p, the 6800xt crushes it. It does well at 4k which is what I use. R/T still has a long way to go so I don\u2019t use that and the 6800xt is too powerful for needing DLSS or FSR. The 6800xt is a much, much better buy than a comparable priced 3070ti.\n\nThe only strange observation I have to report is my Ryzen system boots quicker with this card. I don\u2019t know why\u2026 no idea. The POST time is what has been reduced. Now it takes 10 to 12 seconds to get into the O.S.\n\nSince 2019, I\u2019ve had a RX 580, RX 5700xt, Radeon VII, 1070ti, 1080ti, 3070, and a 3080 in my Ryzen system with a Crosshair VIII Hero board. It would take about 30 seconds to get into the O.S. with these cards. The Pascal cards took the longest.\n\nFan speeds will stay at around 25% to 40% if you don\u2019t set a fan curve. Hot spot temps could be better at stock settings. The card is loud once the fan speeds go above 65%, but it\u2019s not annoying like other cards. GPU wattage is a bit over 250w. It would pay dividends to undervolt this card, but pretty much every CPU & GPU should be undervolted. With every GPU, I recommend undervolting and setting a fan curve that will keep hotspot temps at or below 80c."

This Radeon RX 6800XT Core edition is Absolutely Amazing! When using the Radeon software it overclocks like a Beast as long as you're using a good quality power supply. It scales very well and is very stable with manual overclocks! Also, I was able to get a extra performance boost after I enabled \"smart access memory\" in the bios!\n\nNow, for the only \"CON\" I have regarding this card. I usually water cool ALL of my graphics cards purely for performance, aesthetics and the superior silence over air cooling. So, I was very disappointed that no one makes custom water blocks for the 6800XT Core edition cards! But, there are custom water blocks for the reference 6800 and the 6800XT Black edition cards. I've searched everywhere and learned that EKWB, Alphacool and BykSki do not make water blocks for the core edition cards due to the different PCB layout from the black edition cards.\n\nSo, after I reached out to EK, Alphacool, BykSki and several other waterblock manufacturers to confirm this. I reluctantly upgraded from the 6800XT to the XFX Speedster Zero 6900XT RGB EKWB Limited Edition. I didn't want to upgrade. But, the Zero came with a custom waterblock and it's one of the fastest 6900XT's with only Sapphire's Toxic being the fastest."

A year ago, I didn't get in the EVGA queue, because I was happy with my RTX 2070 Super (definitely regret that). I was gaming on twin 34-inch Superwides at 21:9 UHD 2560 x 1440. Frame rates were good. Then I got a Quest 2 with Virtual Desktop and a dedicated wifii router. I upgraded to faster Memory with 64GB capacity and had the Quest 2 do some of the legwork with the spacewarp feature in Virtual Desktop. Performance was smooth, but quality was just acceptable at medium in VR.\n\nThen I got a Samsung 49-inch Super Ultrawide running 32:9 at 5120 x 1440 this past black Friday and it became clear The RTX 2070 Super just wasn't going to cut it anymore if I wanted full screen 32:9 gaming at those resolutions.\n\nLet me be clear upgrading to the RTX 30380 was a nightmare. First of all, it runs hot as hell (I think especially this XC3 model). Secondly, it draws 100 more watts than the 2070 Super. Fortunately, I researched requirements while I waited for this card to arrive, and I purchased a new power Supply in advance. I upgraded from a 650-watt Power supply to a Corsair 750 watt modular gold power supply.\n\nI popped in the card started gaming and it was stuttering immediately I began to panic, but I took a deep breath and checked temps. I realized immediately the card ran wayyyy too hot for my current chassis configuration. CPU was hitting 100 C and Ambient Temps in the Chassis was cooking with the 3080 in it. So I purchased a Corsair RGB H100i ICUE AIO 240mm cooler to replace my 120mm and I reconfigured the airflow and added fans. Now, I can play games in VR on Ultra and let me tell you the difference is INSANE. It cost me an arm and a leg but now I can get the best out of my screen and my VR games and for me that was worth it.\n\nThe only downside is now my PC is basically a space heater because the new cooling system dumps heat out of my PC at such a high rate. My advice is If you are a medium quality PCVR or Pancake UHD player stay with a 2070 Super and wait for the RTX 4k series possibly launching this summer. But for 4k/5k Gaming or VR, if you can't wait, get the extra flops of 3080 or 3080ti because they make all the difference.\n\nSidenote: Yes, it is nuts to pay what I paid but it also means I can sell my 2070 Super on Ebay for a nice chunk of change because of the current market so you need to consider that. Current bid on my old Card is currently at around 600 bucks which is the MSRP I paid for it 2 years ago, so you can offset the cost a bit."

I was worried about this the most, but there was solid protection, and protective covers on all the connectors (and a protective plastic wrap over the heat plate you'll want to remove).\n\nFirst Steps:\nThe VERY FIRST thing you should do when you receive this card is check that the ID on the board matches the one on the box, and then IMMEDIATELY create an account with EVGA and register the card in your name so you have an active warranty. This card is a nontrivial investment, and registration is quick & painless.\n\nPrice:\nI have been waiting almost two years for this moment. This is as close to MSRP as we've ever seen this puppy get. I jumped on the opportunity, as it's also quite literally the only 3080 that will even remotely fit in my micro ATX case. It gets a little hot, but far below maximum. I can now run most games at max settings. In fact, the only ones that still have sub-60fps at a 4K resolution are Star Citizen and Microsoft Flight Simulator, but pop those down to 1080p and you're above 60fps, whereas without the new gpu, they would fluctuate from 15fps to 30fps.\n\nPower Requirements:\nKeep in mind, we've reached a plateau of power usage and the nextgen 4000-series looks pretty bleak from here. I upgraded my 650w psu to an 850w to prevent throttling at high usage, and am flat out unwilling to put up with 1.5kw for a 4080, much less wait to find out whether any manufacturer will even be able to make one that fits. No thanks. This 3080 will do perfectly until we see those power requirements optimized.\n\nSo far, so good. I love this card. Don't forget to enable resizeable bar in your bios, enable hardware-accelerated gpu scheduling in your OS, set your OS & nvidia power profiles to performance mode, and set your nvidia shader cache to 10GB!"

This card is really quiet too because they want to just generally leave the fans off and let it get to 80c before worrying about it. I am not comfortable with that heat level. So while running Hunt Showdown I kick all three fans to 100% and about 3300RPM I think. That makes the temp way more tamed down to a reasonable level. It is loud, but I play with headset and loud games so not the worst part. The worst part is that all research I did showed that this thing is 100% faster that the 1080ti across the board and in some cats much more. But the proof is in the pudding and while it was fun checking out Quake II RTX my gains in Hunt Showdown were not even apparent at all at times. Like it can not even do 120FPS@ 1080p. The 1080ti holds it's own against the 3080 just fine. maybe like 10 less FPS. I will be going back to it for now. For such an expensive card two generations later I am very, very disappointed to say the least. Outrageous\n\nIt was easy enough to start the return, being sold by Amazon.com itself, but some info was wrong and now getting someone on the phone to handle it is a serious chore. I guess with standards going down everywhere the level of phone support you get here is on the chopping block. Just get someone on the phone that can help already."

I am the current owner now of team (Multiple) GREEN, and team RED GPU's.\n\nThis is after having it for 2-3 months I believe. Didn't look at the purchase date o well..\n\nI did have a few crashes when i first got this GPU. It was software related, the GPU wasn't even out on the market for 1 month at the time. After 2 updates, those crashes do not exist at this point. It wasn't often also, or when under stress like playing STAR CITIZEN, COD, ELITE DANGEROUS, and etc. I had 2 crashes total prior to the updating.\n\nThe previous card, I used to replace the other was a 2080 S. Which is and still is a great GPU. But this thing on performance and benchmarking smokes the 2080s. Also smokes the 3070, its more close to the 3080 in my eyes of performance after comparing just not my own tests. But tests online who do this kind of thing for a living. Not talking about LINUS tech tips either. More of a GAMER NEXUS kind of view on the GPU. Getting this is way cheaper than buying a Nividia by FAR FAR. Not sure how it works on streaming. I don't stream anymore. But thats the only thing they got over team red is that nividia decoder on video is way better. Not saying this card can't do it. I am sure it can do that, and then some. Long as you got a good enough CPU so you can actually get the true power out of this thing. As in for the bottlenecking for most that suffer cause they got themselves a super beefy GPU but are still running an ancient cpu/mobo combo. Also id say get nothing less than 800w PSU cause this thing sucks up the power around 230ish Watts ive seen.\n\nThe cost is what I liked. Not paying 1k+ for a team greener that some scalper was selling up to almost 2k at one point. Therefore i am beyond happy with the purchase. Will I ever buy another Nividia GPU? Of course!! Been buying there items before they were NIVIDIA. \"3DFX\" Just the performance, power, and price you can't beat. There is even the 6850 XT also its a step up from this one. Just make sure you do your research as I did prior. Don't follow others on youtube, that might seem to know but literally are just copy/pasting what main channels do. Ow ya!! Jay two cent's knows his stuff also! Not hating on Linus just I think the other guys do much better presenting there finds and research!\n\nThis also is the MERC319, its the more ramped up version."

The product you get is the Merc version and it is the 6750XT. The packaging was solid and the gpu has the right dimensions. It does not come with a gpu brace, so I would recommend getting one off of Amazon so that you help prevent gpu sag. The performance it what I expected for the card based off benchmarks and videos I have seen, and the noise level is good (no coil whine or loud fans). The logo on the side lights up, and you can download their software to change the colors (no thanks). The games I play (Valorant, Overwatch, GTA V, Witcher 3) run great at 1440p 144hz (with some tweaks for the more demanding titles). So overall I am happy with my purchase."

Excellent performance, low noise, and it looks impressive!\n\nMy previous card was a PowerColor Vega 64 Red Devil which was a similarly large, triple fan card, and when it was running at max load, it sounded like a jet engine, ate up tons of power, and kicked out a ton of heat. The Speedster, by comparison, is quiet and cool.\n\nI was on the fence picking up an RDNA2 card this late into the cycle, since the next generation of cards should be launching later in 2022. I had wanted the XFX 6800XT since its launch and was unwilling to pay the absurd prices the past few years, but that gave me time to re-evaluate how much power I actually needed from a card. Since I still play at 1080p (with plans to get a 1440p monitor at some point soonish) and my cpu is also a few years old, for the price, I came to the conclusion that the 6750XT would be the sweet spot to hold me over for a few years. Absolutely no regrets. This is a great card that runs everything I throw at it and maintains a good frame rate at high/ultra settings.\n\nMy recommendations would be:\nIf you absolutely need a card now, the Speedster MERC319 6750XT is well worth it. Solid design if it fits your build.\nIf you're looking to upgrade from a Vega64 (or similar), its more of a judgement call, but again, I am quite happy with the upgrade.\nIf you have a more recent card, my honest recommendation at this point would be to wait for the next generation.\n\nMinor Update 8/12/22:\nPopped this card into a slightly newer build paired with a 5800x processor - max frame rate is marginally higher, but minimum is also improved, making for silky smooth gameplay at 1080p on high/ultra settings in most games. And this card, despite being a triple fan design, hardly makes any sound under load. After having a few months to play with it, I still absolutely love it!"

                    "text": "I had no justifiable reason to make this purchase.\n\nMy current PC is an X570 based Ryzen 9 5950X machine that was equipped with an MSI branded RTX 2070 Super card. My display is a 1080p 144hz refresh rate Free Sync HP 25mx monitor. For the games I am playing the RTX 2070 Super has been more than adequate.\n\nI saw this Gigabyte card as In Stock and at what appeared to be street price/MSRP and shipped and sold by Amazon and not a 3rd party seller. After checking specs of my current machine, that my case had more than enough clearance for the size of this monstrosity and per Gigabyte's website, my PSU, an Apevia branded 800-Watt Gold certified unit, should be able to carry the load, I impulsively bought this card.\n\nInstallation was easy enough and I have now been running the car for about a week.\n\nDue to my gaming habits and what I am playing and the display I am playing on, I have not experienced any tangible benefit as of yet. I literally just finished playing Far Cry Primal. Yes, it's 2022 and I played Far Cry Primal on a 1080P 144hz display split between an RTX 2070 Super and a RTX 3080 TI. And I have seen no difference. I am sure the monitor low specs are the bottleneck and is why I did not experience any uplift. I am not saying it is not there, but I did not experience anything tangible.\n\nI do understand that the card is more powerful than what I was running but my situation is not giving me a chance to see any uplift hence the folly of this purchase.\n\nThe card itself though consumes significant more power over the RTX 2070 Super. However, compared to other RTX 3080 TI's from Asus, EVGA and MSI, whose cards are recommending 850W, I am hopeful that Gigabyte's 750W recommendation really means 750W and that my non main stream name brand PSU even with its 50W over recommendation buffer will be efficient enough to carry this card. Especially, heading into summer months, I worry that PSU efficiency will drop as ambient room temperature rises. I hope my Central AC can adequately keep this card supplied with cold air and that my PC case has adequate cooling.\n\nEven with playing the aforementioned Far Cry Primal, after about 10 minutes of play, this card definitely kicks into \"high gear\". It starts sucking down the power, and I hit temps of around 72-73C. I used the Gigabyte Aorus Engine software to write performance metrics to a log file while gaming and then input this \"csv\" data into a spreadsheet so I can then sort high to low on the various fields such as power usage in watts, fan speed rpm and temperature.\n\nI should probably run MSI Afterburner's overlay in real time to watch this data since that would be more efficient.\n\nI have read that 3080 series GPU based cards can \"power spike\" and again, I hope that I am within Gigabyte's specs and this does not happen to me. I have yet to play anything modern that engages RT cores and stresses the card. As it is now, the fan noise is significant when the card is under load. I have had PC's that have been more obnoxious sound wise but it is significant enough that you will notice the noise when it is doing its thing.\n\nAgain, going back to the Far Cry Primal game, when actively doing first person stuff, the card spun up and the noise and power draw are significant at this time, but if I would open the in game full screen map, you would hear the card spin down almost immediately as the workload changed. And then when going back to first person action, the card would ratchet back up.\n\nSo I am truly concerned that if the PC is hopping with CPU and GPU maxing out, that I may actually overload the machine or thermally damage something. Again, I should be within spec, but with the noise and the actual \"feel to the touch\" of the exhaust air that comes out the back of this card under load, it is truly something to give you pause. The exhaust is not just \"warm\" but borderline hot. Not as bad as a hair dryer but borderline \"hot\".\n\nI perform no overclocking and run all the components within spec. This card has a factory overclock and I do run my RAM with the XMP 3600 profile, but that is it. No overclocking on my end as far as fiddling with CPU multipliers and bumping voltage or whatever sorcery is needed for Overclocking.\n\nSome other non-gaming thoughts beyond heat, noise, power usage and the aforementioned paranoia.\n\nI did try some transcoding in Handbrake using the H.264 Nvenc encoder. It seems to be decent. At least it does better than the 5950X's multiple threads. I do not really do a lot of video transcoding and I cannot say this is any better or worse than the old RTX 2070 Super but it seems capable if needed for transcoding.\n\nFor my day job, I am fortunate enough to sit at this same PC and drive a glorified RemotePC session, attend Zoom meetings, web browse, and have multiple Mobaterm SSH connections open. For normal non game workloads, the PC sounds like it did with the RTX 2070 Super. PC has the silent ambient sounds of fans doing there thing. No better or worse than before putting this card into service. So for long hours of productivity, I do not have the anxiety that happens when playing games.\n\nRegistering the card on the Gigabyte Aorus website to claim the 4th year of warranty was easy enough.\n\nI realize this write up is scatterbrained and all over the place. It comes across as though I regret this purchase and I do not. While, paying the premium for a card of this class for my situation may not have been the best course of action, I am excited to use this card going forward. I do hope to get a better monitor, something in the 1440P high refresh range. I tend to hold onto my PCs for several years and since the AMD AM4 platform is at the end of the road, I do not see any significant upgrades beyond this in the machine's future. With the rumors of what RDNA3 and NVidia Ada Lovelace will potentially draw, I do not see that type of card in this machine's future since I would have to replace the PSU with a beefier one.\n\nIf you are in a situation where you have a display that can take advantage of this class GPU, and a PC with adequate power, cooling, and clearance, then by all means indulge yourself if you are not financially hurting yourself. Just make sure to temper your actual need over want. I did not take this advice myself but I realized that before making this purchase."

                    "text": "I plan to updated this review as I get time to do some testing so bare with me.\n\nSo far the few things I tested the temps barley went up a few degrees. I plan to test a few more intense games such as Metro Exodus and CyberPunk 2077.\n\nI've heard undervolting these cards can make them run cooler and quieter with little to no loss in performance. I plan to do some voltage testing and give updates here for others to benefit from.\n\nGUIDE TO UNDERVOLTING:\n\nThe idea of undervolting is to get the same or more performance from your GPU with lower power usage and better temperatures. Generally GPUs are designed to have an optimal power usage to run it, that optimal level is usually much higher than needed and thus causes excess heat and increases your power bill. Most video cards can get more out of it for less power if not, at the very least the same. Additionally, your video card won\u2019t dynamically clock as much giving you varying FPS spikes.\n\nFew things to note before we begin:\n1. Before you get your hopes up you should understand that not all GPUs are made equally and your millage may vary, but regardless you should get something out of this if you do this correctly.\n\n2. This does not harm your video card if done correctly, if anything it will potentially make it last longer. This also does not void your warranty. That being said, I nor anyone else who instructs you how to do this will NOT be held responsible if you do something wrong and somehow blow up your video card. Feel free to do your own additional research.\n\n3. Game crashing is normal during testing, as this is trial and error till you figure out what is a stable setting for your GPU.\n\nSTEP 1:\nDownload and install \"MSI Afterburner\". I will not be linking this, you can search this online and find the program. I will also assume you learned to set up the on screen monitoring. Do a search on that too so you can make sure everything is working correctly in STEP 4. You can do that in the Afterburner settings menu. I recommend having at least Framerate, GPU Power usage, GPU voltage, GPU temperature, GPU ram, Core Clock and Memory Clock usage on. You might even want to play a few games and see what your temperature and clock speeds hover at before so you have something to compare.\n\nSTEP2:\nOpen MSI Afterburner, click the gear icon seen in my second image circled blue. This will open the settings menu. In my image 3, make sure those settings match your settings menu.\n\nSTEP 3:\nOnce that is done go back to my image 2, and click the button circled in red or click \u201cCTRL+F\u201d on your MSI Afterburner. This will bring up a curve editor menu as seen in my image 4. Keep both MSI Afterburner and this curves menu open side by side and follow each sub step below:\n\n1. In image 2, there is a section boxed in yellow. Pull the Core Clock slider down to -250 on your Afterburner and click the check mark at the bottom center located under your GPU name. You should see the curves editor updated with that change.\n\n2. In my image 4, you can see my curve editor for reference. On the bottom of your curve editor, you will find the millivolt (mV) and on the left you will see the core clock speed. We already brought it down -250, so the next goal is to select a millivolt and pull it up to the appropriate core clock speed. In my case I set it at .875mV at 1905mhz core clock. I\u2019ve seen some as low as .830mV at 1905 and beyond but it crashes for me lower than this so it will vary for you too. I suggest starting at around .830-.850mv at 1900mhz+. Once done, once again click that check mark button, but this time press the \u201cfloppy disk\u201d icon to the left of the check mark button and click the \u201c1\u201d to the right side of your Afterburner to save your voltage curve. This way you can click the \u201c1\u201d to select this voltage profile. You can make many more if you choose to by testing what works for you.\n\nSTEP 4:\nNow in this step, we want to make sure you have on screen monitoring on as stated in STEP 1. Run a game, preferably something current and high end. Cyberpunk 2077 is a good example, but something like Control Ultimate Edition or Horizon Zero Dawn will do. Play normally and see if everything is running smooth. If you experience no crashes after a few hours then your clock should be stable. If you\u2019re feeling bold, you can try lowering power at the same core clock speed or increasing speed at same power usage.\n\nHowever, if you crash return to STEP 3 and try a higher voltage with the same or lower core clock speed. This is trial and error so be patient. Try different games once one is stable too, just in case. Once you settled on your clock speed you should have better power to performance than stock but how much depends on your silicon lottery. You should be getting a few degrees cooler and using a bit less power.\n\nBONUS TIP FOR THOSE RUNNING EXTRA HOT CARDS:\nYou can get even better temperatures if you replace your thermal pads inside your GPU. Do an online search if this tutorial was not enough to get your thermals low enough."

Most games that I run (on ultra settings with a 60 FPS frame cap), it hardly made any noise, but once I run Cyberpunk 2077 or any other triple A game uncapped, the fans or heat sink make a high pitch noise so I would have to cap or lower my settings.\nUnder heavy load, the GPU temps ran very high; heating up the entire system averaging around 75~80 C. I regretfully went with an air CPU cooler and saw that temperatures stayed at a steady mid-high during most usage.\n\nOverall; works great, very expensive, and runs worryingly hot and noisy."

The newest most power Ryzen 9 \\ 5900 CPU, fast memory and a 750 watt power supply. The NVIDIA GPU ran like hot garbage on my Ubuntu system. Ubuntu has a nasty sepia color scheme that saturates the entire OS and everything in it. It is not only ugly but painful to look at due to my vision issues.\n\nI did not know for sure at the time but, I hoped a new video card from someone other than NVIDIA might perform better. Turns out this AMD designed GPU got rid of the nasty sepia tint. This video card creates a simple un-tinted OS that is a pleasure to use. The card is not BIG and uses only the power supplied by the GPU slot.\n\nThe card has some energy saver garbage installed that turns the card off if you power down your monitor. I took a star off for the energy saver mess. There really are no other issues. This is a great card to use on a Linux\\Ubuntu system that is not used for hard core gaming."

The Amazon website had a lot more information than the box.\nThe Amazon website says that KAER offers 24-hour technical support, but doesn't say what the URL for that is and neither does the box. www.kaer.com is an air-conditioning company, and Google just turns up a ton of false hits.\nWhen I installed the card and turned the CPU on, it only detected one monitor and was confused about it. Windows -> System -> Display says it was 1024x769 with no other options, but stuff that was supposed to be in the center of the screen was at the edge of the screen. Websites kept coming up where the buttons were off the bottom of the screen when the top of the window was at the top of the screen.\nThe colors were all wrong, too.\nI figured it was a driver problem, so with great difficulty I went to the NVIDEA website and downloaded the driver for the NVIDEA Geforce GT 730 (the box says nothing about NVIDEA and there are no directions, I was just going by what the Amazon website said).\nInstalling the driver made no difference. I did it twice.\nI give up. I'm sending this back to Amazon, never buying anything from KAER again."

Because the ati graphic i had died not being even 2 years old and more expensive i decided to buy this one. Card does not come with driver or instructions how to get them. It took me half a day to get the actual Nvidia drivers do run with win11. It seems to run okish now but I'm having problems with the video im working on that i didn't have before with the old card."

Sadly, the built-in video card in the older computer was not strong enough to support the max resolution.\n\nThis video card did exactly that. And it is fine for a computer that is used for surfing, basic desktop work, etc. But once you want to watch a full-screen 4K video it struggles. Badly.\nTo be fair here, the 10-series were not built for 4K. But it needs to be said: it is one thing to do static work on 4K resolutions; once you go to a high-quality media display this is not the card you are looking for.\n\nSo this card does what it needs to do - and it will perform fine for most things in resolutions under 4k. It is affordable and available. But don't buy this one for high-quality gaming or intensive video or animation work."

I received an open box (no factory tape on the folds) and no documentation on the inside. No disk, manual, or anything for that matter other than the card. Obviously a return. Forewarned is forearmed and I had already gone to the Maxsun website and downloaded the latest drivers. I installed the card and, in fairness, works as advertised. The vendor just needs to ensure that the documentation is in every box. I also haven't registered it (no disk asking me to) but will do that on the website. Arrived on time."

Absolutely yes! Fits right in slim designed case , total install time was 10 min if that. I have looked high and I've looked low for a form fitting card for the x51 without a massive power overhaul. This card is not what I call \"gaming\" ready but the price point should sell you that. Overall it's slim will definitely fit in a modular case and does the trick of you are looking to do anything that's graphic hungry. Minus of course Fortnite at 60fps consistent. The value is peek. The extra 2gb of room helps to. Hope this is your final review to read before pulling the trigger. I did , great product in an oversaturated market currently"

Though in Beam.NG, visual settings have to be set to Low for decent-good FPS. It keeps at a decent temperature (35-45\u00b0C) while being run at 100% consistently. If you're looking for a good GPU for 3D dense programs such as Second Life, this one is more then capable with the sacrifice of FPS (25-30 at High, 10-15 at Ultra graphics settings)."
