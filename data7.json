There's no way to enter the desired value directly. For example, if the channel is set to 2 and you want 60, you have to click thru all 58 channels. This makes setting recording times very tedious.\n\nIf the included TV programming guide software is used to program a show to record, it wipes out all of the manually programmed times. Also, the guide sometimes fails to record the requested program.\n\nThe driver for the remote control crashes rending the remote non-function. This happens even when the remote is not in use.\n\nAfter installing the TV card, I've found that sometimes the video will not come back on after the Windows power save turns it off.

Dying Light 2, Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077, etc. I can play these new AAA games at Ultra Settings 1440P with Raytracing and still get normally well over 100 fps. Stuff like indie games, E-Sports games, MMOs like WoW/FF14 I can play Ultra 1440P and hit my monitors max refresh rate of 165 fps at all times. It\u2019s amazing. I included pictures of the GPU in and out of my system. It\u2019s a pretty beefy card. Make sure your case has room. It\u2019s a 3x slot design with 3x fans and a back plate. There is some subtle RGB lighting on the card which you can adjust to your liking. The card itself I can\u2019t ever hear. I have mine overclocked +500mhz memory clock and +100mhz core clock. My core clock runs at 2070mhz and memory clock at 10,000mhz and my GPU never passes 64-65C under full load. All this while being silent using auto mode fan speeds which never pass 70% speed. The GPU is quite, powerful, looks good, and doesn\u2019t sag when installed. Amazing card IMO especially for 650 US dollars. When overclocked you get very close to the performance of an RTX 3080 for significantly less money. I have this GPU paired with a Ryzen 7 5800X, and 32GB(4x8GB) of 3600mhz CL16 memory. On an Asus X570 Prime - Pro Motherboard all powered by a Seasonic Focus 80+ Gold 850 Watt Power Supply. As a whole the system runs like a dream. Anything I wanna play at 1440P Ultra settings I can well over 100 fps. If someone had a 4K monitor they could easily game at 4k on this GPU provided they have a good CPU to match its power. So far not had a single issues with this card. Of all the 3070 ti models it\u2019s considered an A tier model. With some of the best components, VRMs, overclocking, cooling, and power limits. If you can get this GPU for 700 or under its well worth it IMO. Check out the pics and thanks for reading. EDIT - Reading other reviews I notice several people complain about the software and RGB on the card. For me personally I have had no issue with either. The lighting looks great, has worked flawlessly since install and took me two mins to set up. The software while not amazing takes a couple mins to install. Once I installed it and matches the RGB lighting on my GPU to the color profile of everything else I hit save and that\u2019s literally it. I\u2019ve never had to touch or open the Software ever again. Used it one time for two mins that\u2019s it. If I wanted to change the pattern, lighting, color, etc of the GPU I easily can. As you can see in the pics I run a blue/black theme setup and I basically leave it at that. If your someone who constantly changes the lighting and colors in your system maybe the software might have some issues idk. For what little time I used it to setup my lighting it worked perfectly and has kept my profile saved without me ever have opening or used it since. You can even make it so the lighting is one way/color when the system is on and a different way/color when the system is off. If your someone who plans to install it just to find a lighting color/pattern you like and save it/leave it for me it worked flawlessly. Had the card 3 months now still working like it did from day 1."}, {"title": "Good buy when it\u2019s on sale.", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2022", "text": "I bought this GC on sale for 35% off so my value for money was fantastic.

That comes in two forms: Fan noise, and coil whine.\n\nNow I'm not an industry expert on who has more coil whine in general among the brands. I have heard MSI is on the low side, and I have a 980ti that never had any coil whine, to the point where I didn't know what it was until I bought a 1080ti from Asus and it had a TON.\n\nThis 3080ti I have from MSI does have some moderate coil whine, but it's the good kind. You are probably going to get some from any GPU of this power, completely normal. This is low, and not at frequencies that are bothersome. It makes you really know when she's working hard.\n\nNow on to the part MSI has some control over: The fan noise. Lack-there-of. Really quiet even at full load, but I normally have the fans turned down really low, 30-35%. Just enough to keep them spinning. But the important part that MSI did do correctly that makes that possible is how good the fans and the cooler are.

If you're on a budget it's worth saving 100 dollars on a non-RGB card if you can and don't care about lighting effects.\n\nOperating temperatures with my custom fan curve tend to be 45C at idle and 70C at full load with my modest overclock and no undervolting. This is very good for the power draw this card has, so it is a big plus.\n\nThis card seems to overclock well considering it can't be pushed past 102% power draw in MSI Afterburner. I'm able to have a stable +120 on the core and +600 on the memory, which isn't far off from what the cards that can do 115-120% power draw are able to hit. (Note: Please remember to consult guides and videos on overclocking before attempting to do so yourself.)\n\nThe card requires 3 8-pin connectors. A very large amount of power supplies, both OEM and aftermarket, do not have 3 of them by default (my Corsair RM850x for example only includes 2 8-pin cables), so if you have a modular PSU you'll want to buy an extra 8-pin PCIe cable that matches your power supply's manufacturer. Even though they often have multiple 8-pin connectors on one cable, you CAN NOT use the same cable for multiple slots. I recommend CableMod's cables as they're good quality and look pretty nice, albeit at a bit of a price premium. Just make 100% sure you buy the cable that matches your PSU. You can NOT use a cable intended for a Corsair power supply on a EVGA power supply or etc.\n\nThe fans have a minimum operating speed of 30%, meaning you can't turn them off for a 0-noise experience when the system is at idle or under very light loads.

The design is tasteful, and it comes with a support horizontal bracket. Performance in traditional game titles is excellent and reliable. Thermal outputs are shockingly low and fans perform quietly throughout. I am so impressed with MSI cooling technology and shroud design. Now that the VR stuttering problems have resolved, it is fair to recommend the RTX 3080 12G between $800-1000. I have extensively put all of my cards to task with Adobe Premiere Pro, Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 077, Halo 4, and Mech Warrior 5. Goodness! Graphics look gorgeous, and performance improvements are respectable compared to my GTX 1080 Ti. In short, the RTX 3080 12G units are worth every penny, and now they finally work in VR! At $850 for the MSI 12G is a no brainer! They deserve the highest recommendations.\n\nP.S., MSRP has dropped to $799 for the 3080 12G version. This MSI card, the Aorus Master and the Asus cards being offered between $800-$850 hold my highest recommendations. I could not perceive any gaming performance differences between this version compared to the 3080 Ti nor the 3090 in 4K gaming. Hence, I strongly believe that 99% of gamers who operate at or under 4K and 120fps would NOT need anything above this level making the Nvidia RTX 4000 series and AMD RX 7000 series a moot purchase. With the latter offerings, consumers will have no choice but to upgrade the PC case with a strong airflow design and a new power supply unit (PSU) and the CPU and the motherboard as lower count CPU (fewer than 6 cores) may potentially throttle these cards. For many users, this essentially requires a new PC build."}, {"title": "Powerhouse", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2022", "text": "Literally a beast.

Solid performance, quiet when it isn\u2019t stressed, good build quality. This thing is tough! My friend dropped it when I was building, and I had trouble getting my graphics card to appear in bios so I reslotted many times, screwed in and out, even almost ripped out the motherboard clamp when installing into a Msi motherboard (first build lol). Just shows MSI\u2019s build quality. However, there were some corners cut in the rgb. Also the card is massive so make sure you get a big enough case and use the included riser so it doesn\u2019t sag too much.\n\nPros:\nGreat performance ~ 140-190 fps in 1440p gaming\nBuild quality\nIt\u2019s a graphics card at a reasonable price\n\nCons:\nRgb is horrid. The plastic cover over it is cloudy and when the rgb turns on the hot spots are clear as day.\nFans get super noisy under stress, I can hear it with a headset on.\n\nOverall, if you find it at a good price, it\u2019s one of the best 3080 cards with a high boost clock out the factory.\n\nUpdate:\nA month after using, my gpu died randomly. It was the same problem I was having when I first built it, the gpu was not recognized in device manager, nvidia, or in the bios. When it happened the first time, I thought it was my fault\u2026 but maybe it\u2019s the Msi gpu or Msi motherboard. Horrible experience. I was just playing valorant with my friends and boom my two monitors say \u201cNo input signal\u201d. This gpu was not stressed at all, valorant isn\u2019t intensive even on the highway settings and my fps limit was 190, gpu usage while playing was 30-35%. There was no reason for it to overheat at temperatures were around 58 C. I have no idea what it is and I\u2019m sending my pc to a repair shop to have them test out a different gpu in my system to see if it\u2019s the motherboard or gpu. Even if it is the motherboard, horrible experience from Msi, I don\u2019t know what to say. My integrated graphics on my i7-12700k works just fine and I will be using that until my new motherboard or gpu comes in, and I\u2019m making sure to get asus products. Unbelievable and nightmare experience from a first time builder.\n\nAnother update: just filed an rma request for my 3080, return time is 15-30 business days\u2026 I don\u2019t even know what to say, shipping is paid on my end too. So far the experience left me with 2 sleepless nights, carrying my heavy pc into my car (2 blocks away) down from the 9th floor of my apartment into a pc shop and back up, and 32$ shipping. The reason it\u2019s 32$ is because when I first built the pc and the card didn\u2019t work, I ordered another one from B&H as I was about to return my Amazon one since I thought it was broken and they made me pay shipping as well. The pc shop tested a different gpu and it worked fine, meaning it\u2019s this card specifically. Good one MSI.\n\nFinal Update (hopefully): I just got my 3080 card back from the repair center, and it works! I can say the RMA service for Msi is okay. I had to call for my package to get scanned and actually worked on and then another to get an update on where my gpu is in the process. It spent a total of about 2 weeks at the center, and 10 days to ship back to me. It was a long process, but it worked. I also sent my gpu with the riser and original packaging and lost both. I got it sent back in a generic white package with padding, no riser or manuals came back to me. This could be my fault since I didn\u2019t read everything on the RMA, but I just sent everything in case I get a replacement. Still annoying, but I\u2019m happy my pc is finally running, if anything else happens I will be sure to update."}, {"title": "about the card", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2022", "text": "very good card"}, {"title": "La mejor gr\u00e1fica para juegos", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2022", "text": "Tiene un gran rendimiento y mantiene una buena temperatura con un 100% de uso"}]}, {"label": "ASUS TUF Gaming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti OC Edition Graphics Card (PCIe 4.0, 24GB GDDR6X, HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4a, Dual Ball Fan Bearings, Military-Grade Certification, GPU Tweak)", "price": "1,529.00", "description": "The TUF Gaming GeForce RTX\u2122 3090 Ti has been built up to provide more robust power and cooling.

The Watercooler works, it cools down the GPU way below normal levels for this type of GPU.\nNormal temperature for this GPU would be around 74-70 where this solution will lower it to 55-60 depending on your case configuration. The performance is also top notch, the GPU clock always stays at 2025Mhz and there is no need for OC as you will hardly get a single frame increase, not worth the hassle. Just so you have an idea, at 2070Mhz clock the most you could get is 1 FPS increase on Dying Light 2 (maxed out).\n\nThe default profile is more than enough. You could install GPU Tweak III if you want but it's not a solid software and it is buggy, also not needed.\n\nNow the bad news. The fans provided by ASUS are clearly on the cheap side, noise as hell and insufficient for this type of All-in-One watercooler. Please remember that this poor unit with only 240mm 2 x 120mm FAN must absorb more than 400Watts of heat. Clearly it is not enough. I hate ASUS because of this, because they decided a 240mm radiator instead of a 360mm for compatibility reasons.\n\nI've researched all the watercooled solutions and the block provided on this card along with the actual PCB were better than competing solutions so I paid the price for it and have to accept it's limitations. 240mm is not enough if you want the best heat dissipation.\n\nHaving said that, there is a way around it. Using a pair of Noctua's NF-12x25 PWM the noise can be mitigated big time. Those FAN's are clearly superior to the stock fans provided.\n\nNow if you want to really push this card into low noise operations, you will need a 2 pair of Phanteks T30-120 in push-pull.\n\nWith that combination, you can set front fans to 1300RPM and back fans to 1000 RPM and have similar performance to the Noctuas at 2000RPM and almost the same heat disipation performance of the stock fans running at 2500 RPM but with a much lower noise level. With these FANs the product is in much better shape.\n\nWhat you can't avoid here is the pump noise. It's high pitch and cannot be lowered. It is too bad that ASUS decided on such a noise pump. If you have a truly silent PC (like I have) you will hate it. So this is not a product designed for people that loves a completely dead silent PC.\n\nOnce you game, you will forget about the noise pump as it will produce less noise due to water heat and also FANs noise.\n\nAll in all a very good product. I won't do any 3090 Ti on air cooling as the hum from those tiny fans is intolerable and on watercooling solutions you can tweak your FANs to your heart's content.\n\nNext product must have a 360mm radiator to be top performing, but I'm satisfied with this. Just know that the standard FANs provided are noise as hell and will need to be replaced if you want a more silent system."}, {"title": "Sin lugar a dudas la mejor tarjeta gr\u00e1fica del mercado hasta hoy", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2022", "text": "Muy buen acierto de anexarle su propio radiador para enfriamiento.

And I'm glad I did. Very good card for 1080p @ 60fps.\n\nIt's paired with my Ryzen 5 2600 (Stock), 16GB RAM (4GBx4) @ 2666Mhz, 2 SSDs, and one 2TB HDD. As a performance example, I can play Mass Effect Andromeda on Ultra Settings at 60fps, and when I disable V-Sync, the card throws out 75-80fps. I suspect it can run the latest games on High to Very High Settings at 1080p.\n\nGreat card if you're coming from a 900 series card.

You may run into some issues on smaller form-factor motherboards such as mATX. This card can extend over one of the very limited number of PCI-e slots, but the length of the card is definitely manageable (SC Ultra Gaming model). So far I've not had any issues with EVGA cards, so I can't comment about their customer support side, but the cards themselves seem to be very solid graphics cards.\n\nAs far as performance goes, if you're still on an older graphics card, 900 series and down, there's a noticeable performance bump. It's not exactly night and day depending on what you're upgrading from, but if your current video card bites the dust and you can't get a hold of the current 3000 series or even 2000 series, this one will get the job done.. IF.. you can find it for a reasonable price.\n\nAt the prices people are asking for this card right now, which can be double or triple the roughly $200 asking prices I was seeing in late 2020, to me at least, it's a hard sell at roughly ~$400 to ~$600 for a card that is already showing its age with current games. At current prices, in my humble opinion, the \"value for the money\" just isn't there, though my rating reflects the price of the card at the time I purchased it.\n\nBut, if you find yourself in a situation where you need a replacement card, amid all the price gouging going on, it's a decent card, just a VERY expensive one for what you do get at today's prices.

When I purchased this product, Amazon guaranteed delivery on Sunday Feb. 6, 2022. On the 6th, I woke up to an email that it would be delayed until Monday the 7th. No problem, we had a blizzard and people have been digging out. BUT, it was delivered on Sunday and just left outside, in the freezing cold and snow, without me knowing or expecting it was going to happen. Luckily, a friend stopped in for five minutes, and by coincidence that's when the package was left in the cold and snow, so it wasn't there when he came up the porch, but it was there when he went down and my package got to me safely. The seller bears no responsibility for this, as it was fulfilled by Amazon, but for some reason, Amazon doesn't let us write reviews for the customer service, so here it is. You can do better, Amazon.\n\nAs for the product itself, it's not really as bad as my \"stars\" would suggest. It arrived in what appears to be brand new packaging. I can't find any evidence that the anti-static bag was ever opened before. I installed it in my aging Dell Inspiron 3700 (with an i5-8400, and 12GB of RAM) hooked it all up, turned it on, and after about 5 minutes of some installation process (at which time there WAS video) my screen automatically reverted to the display settings it had prior to the install, and it works just fine. I installed Nvidia GeForce and, after one more driver update it was over. The entire process was from start to finish was less than 20 minutes.\n\nThis was the first time I have ever installed a GPU, and I can only assume that that is EXACTLY how it is supposed to work. As for the value for money, NO GPU has a good value to money ratio. Crypto-miners and the pandemic have seen to that.\n\nAs for gaming, this just is NOT a card built to plays today's most advanced games. I got this card because PGA 2K21 can only track one profile at a time, so two people with two profiles need two copies of the game to track their stats in co-op. Now, my aging Dell could manage about 25 FPS in \"potato mode,\" a number that made it unplayable. With this card, on low settings (one step up from potato mode), this card and the i5 deliver 90FPS steadily at 1080p quality.\n\nThe problem there, is that 2K21 is really \"The Golf Club 3\" with 2K's marketing slapped on the box. As such, the entire install from Steam was just 6.6GB. And as every modern gamer knows, the 5-15GB game file size was lost to any game above the 'indie\" classification when the games went 4K. Which means that the game would have to still be in potato mode if 4K textures even existed in the files for processing.\n\nThe only other \"modern\" game I have on the Dell is Kerbal Space Program. And that, with low settings turned on, and the FPS locked to 80, this card and the i5 can get maintain a steady 60 in the assembly buildings and launchpad, and dropped into the 40 FPS range during the launches I tested. But that is normal. KSP can make even monster PC's cry for mercy if the user launches a big enough ship. The limitation there is far more CPU dependent than GPU dependent as the game tries to simulate physics, heat, and gravity calculations on hundreds of individual parts simultaneously.\n\nAs for video streaming, honestly, I don't see very much improvement over the streaming quality of just the i5, but there is no LESS quality to the streaming, and that's what matters. My monitor is a 32\" 1440p, with a 144 Hz refresh rate.\n\nI do, however, have a couple of issues with this card. On the product description page, there is clearly a picture of the various output I expected to find on this card. And if I remember right that picture had a display port, an HDMI port, a 24 pin DVI port, and a VGA port (I might be wrong about the VGA port). The card that arrived at my house, does NOT have either a VGA port or a display port. So, if your monitor has either of those, BUYER BEWARE!!! I was only ever going to use the HDMI port, so I'm not too fussed.\n\nMy bigger issue is the plastic shroud on the GPU itself. The card doesn't cover the same amount of area that the plastic shroud does, so I have several square inches of exposed plastic shroud inside my PC, acting as a \"bowl\" to catch any dust flying around. And while the Dell has a paper filter the covers the main air intake, and a sort of cone directing the CPU exhaust directly out into the room and that has kept the amount of dust inside my case to a minimum. But now there is the GPU fan sourcing air from an unfiltered area, and just exhausting the air inside the case. So, ALL bets are off as to how this plays out in the remaining life left in my aging Dell.\n\nThat is just BAD design all the way around. It uses more material than is strictly needed meaning the manufacturer is paying more than is strictly necessary for each card manufactured, and it CAN'T be good for the PC to have an actual dust catcher inside a machine that you work hard to keep dust free. And I can PROMISE the manufacturer, that if my aging Dell suddenly dies six weeks from now, I know EXACTLY who I will blame. I won't get a refund, but THEY won't get a return customer.\n\nAnd for that reason, ultimately, I will give this GPU a 3-star rating with a serious \"BUYER BEWARE\" due to the misleading product photos, as well as the poorly designed fan shroud."}, {"title": "Overall great value, but missing a 2nd HDMI out", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2022", "text": "This graphics card works well in our limited-power mini-tower.\n\nIt'd be perfect for our needs if it had a 2nd HDMI port, but a simple adapter cable did the trick since one of the two monitors we hooked up had that necessary DVI port as well as its HDMI port.\n\nI can recommend this card as a good performance/value graphics card for your limited-power computer."}, {"title": "Do you want an Nvidia account /", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2022", "text": "Received it in a timely manner from Amazon, that part went well.

I feel i need to do this because i'm not just reviewing this card as a 3080, but really as a gaming tool. I actually really am writing this cause i want to help. this is a lot of money and i really have a lot of concerns after trying this.\n\n- its' hot, the memory is especially hot you can undervolt and do all this stuff to fix it. but kind of lame for the cost. I mean fine i'm a cs major i can do it, but it 's a hassle and it's a compromise on a high end card that costs a ton of money.\n\nThe card:\nI'm going to be honest here. compared to a 1080ti (i had paid 400 for this) or rx 480 (200) yeah sure it's faster it's not that big of a deal. Most games are written for consoles.\n\nLet me give you the 1080 ti as an example cyberpunk. 2k monitor 60hz. You will be hard pressed to tell the difference. With fsr you can utterly max out this game and on my 1080ti. On the 1080 ti i'm getting 75f (23 c)temps to maybe 119f , yes F!!!. I put in the 3080 the card is running at 80c. I mean freaking insane. that's c vs f there. Not a mistake. Granted the 1080ti is an evga, and this is a \"cheaper\" msi card, but the evga 1080 ti cost me 400 new years ago. now with FSR and soon fsr2 i dont' see the point. I though ray tracing would be cool. to me it's not. Actually i dont' care at all. It doesn't make much difference to the game ok for me none. So here we go why is this a remotely compelling product. It doesn't really do anything new, it's runs way too hot, and it's at the EOL with nvidia's business model. They'll jsut stop supporting it. I think this is a very fair comparison. It's a card for 5 years ago that was half the cost new, and a level up and competes very favorably in a lot of ways.\n\n-- This 3080 thing is huge too costly, and overly marked up even after mining. I mean it's hot as hell. You can undervolt and do all this crap to fix it, but man why am i doing that? It sounds like a jet. I'm using a half x 932 advanced case with insane level of fans. W/o tweaks i'm getting 80c + here.\n\nAMD Vs Nvidia.\nAMd is now supporting nvidia hardware better than nvidia fsr /fsr2. Think about this. Now i finally get it for me this really comes back to raytracing. it's pretty pointless. I used to use brick and mortar stores to try stuff. Note i LOVE amazon. they are great, but i'd have loved to had seen this card before i bought it. You really cant' tell form youtube. I dont' see anything compelling here for the money. I waited 2 years to pay 800 for a overly hot video card. I mean sure if this were 5-600 it might be ok. but 800 why? OK maybe you are a 4k gamer and want 120 hz refresh. this might be for you. I don't' see that taking off any time soon with these prices. Look 1060 is still the biggest card on steam for a reason. These are the smart folks if you ask me. i would just get an amd card where they put all the performance toward rasterization, or wait for cards to continue to fall back in prices to where they should be, or get a consoles. there are a ton of options that seem better to me personally. I'm not even anti nvidia, i think amd cards are too costly too. I just think these are even more too costly. Xbox hands down is better deal until these guys adust.\n\nPower usage is really high already. I mean the 1080 ti is silent no heat and my computer works much better. and yes i have an very high airflow case with a side panel. Same case same spot my 1080ti is running 90f (Ferinheight) vs the 3080 at 86 c (i was hitting). are you kidding me. I wonder what would happen if i just overclocked my 1080ti to the point it got that hot if there would even be a difference.\n\nVs consoles:\n\nhere's the reality. i can get a series x right now on the msft store it's easy probably even on amazon. completely cant' tell the difference sure on paper this is faster, but i've been down this road before. They optimize the console it close the gap at least a tier higher like 3070 level. I mean that why this card was suppose to be 600 in the first place. It's always been about flexibility on pc, yes i like mods, i like the online experience it's great, i like a little extra effects, but seriously i can get a console for half this price easy, and the deal is with the optimizations on that hardware, and trust me it's no joke, it's very close. People talk about tflops and such. Sure it's a little better 1/3 pretty close toa 6700xt actually, but in reality when you have the memory so close to the gpu and cpu and all the crazy optimizations it's close to a 3070 minimum over time. It's the truth. Games are cheaper on xbox too you can get used. it's just a better experience in a lot of ways. Yeah i wanted to pc game but these companies are so out of touch. They aren't living up to the expectations. Mining is really stupid, just in so many ways, but but where ti's impacted me is the gpu greed has run these prices up to insane levels. For nothing. This was such a let down. I'll take xbox over this at these prices even still. I'd really have to think if it was 600. wtih my xbox i'm getting a 3700 cpu, 6700xt gpu and 16gb of ddr6 ram totally focused to gaming, and full attention of devs. This card really should be 500 at this point. They have a ton of supply, it's on a cheap node, and it's a hassle because the cooling and power draw sucks.\n\nThis card was suppose to be 600 2 years ago, it's 800 now. I 'm just honestly not satisfied. Go ahead and buy it, but i'm telling you i was disappointed but hey that's me.\n\nThese costs are out of control. Compared to the series x i really dont' think ti's all that much better in say cyberpunk wither 3 or any of the games i play. In fact other than load times i dont' think anyone is too worried about cutting edge hardware after 2 years of nobody being able to get it other than for generating fake money.\n\nThis is my opinion,\n\nRay tracing is insanely overblown. I saw flashes of light. who cares?\n\nNvidia stuff in general: with fsr /fsr2 coming i'm able to get pretty great performance out of much cheaper hardware i don't need dlss. makes me really question nvidia. i think i'm switching to amd they support old stuff better, and finally their drivers are good anyway now. Yes they sucked before which is why i had left the rx 480 in 1017 for the 1080ti evga for 400 new.\n\nThis card specifically: This thing is huge too costly, and overly marked up even after mining. These should be like 600 at best. I say screw tsmc too. Raising prices I'd rather just have a cheaper node with new features and slightly less fast. These guys just don't' get it. I mean it's hot as hell. You can undervolt and do all this crap to fix it, but man why am i doing that? It sounds like a jet.\n\nPC gaming Don't' know guys i'm really starting to question pc gaming. It was always more but even after mining these prices aren't adjusting fast enough for me. I think i'm going to skip next generation too see if it's just me. IF it is i'll stick with consoles or go do something else. If their market share starts to shrink then maybe i'll consider it. This chip shortage stuff has been going on for several years now. Right it's nto just gaming. but hey Sony and Microsoft aren't stupid enough to pay these prices so why should i be. Eventually they have to fix this. Cause other things like computers for work need this stuff too. Maybe it takes a couple more years, possibly not buying this will motivate them, or maybe it won't. The way i see this is total profit = sales * profit. I think think there is an over emphasis on profit and not on sales number go look at the steam hardware survey.\n\nUltimately i didn't have any more fun on this than i did on my pascal card. I think i'm going to jump ship on nvidia and switch to amd next, and or sit on my console another generation and re assess if and when prices come down. Pc gaming has just gotten too expensive, too hot, and too much dramma. I ultimately didn't have much fun dealing with all this, and really just fretted about the money and temps, voltage etc. With my console, or older card i just enjoyed it. Nvidia and really to some extent amd, and these manufactures or whatever we call them have removed all the fun from pc gaming for me. It's horrible taste in my mouth and i really hated this product when i factored in the cost. Form what i'm hearing of the new ones they are just getting hotter and need like a kilowatt. hell i'd take a 4060-70 for a few hundred if we can do that. It's probably close to this. So i say whats the rush here. Console is the play at this point in time.\n\nIN conclusion if i'm a game developer will i write games for 800 dollar gpus, of course not, and it shows. I mean your lucky to get support for a 400 gpu. yeah it used to be premium you can get more smoke and cool effects for a couple hundred, which is why i have the 1080ti, id' bite but this is 2x the cost vs the xbox, and it's not 2x better. It's like 10% better MAX. The only way you'll ever see the features of this card full utilized is if nvidia goes in and writes all the games or you really desire super high frame rate. I guess i just dont' care.\n\nhere's the fix: sell this card for 500. that would be worth it and actually have some value. Just stay on the cheaper node, and optimize power usage by adding more chip l2 /l3 cache, and using slower ram. Forget about this insanley trillion dollar fab cutting edge stuff. That's a product i'd actually like to buy. the more i hear the less excited i am for the future. I think after using this that's the product i'm looking for. I make good money, i like gaming but i'd also like to retire someday.

MSI, ASUS etc are all refusing the new stuff until they clear the old so they are basically facing off now since TSMC gave nvidia a reprieve. Look there isn't a complete intersection between amd and nvidia. Two originally this was 700, but they pushed it up to 1k, and down a little now. Yes it's a cut down ti, but here's the thing it's still not a great value and the cost to make these is 40% of this. This is 800 at this time. It's fine to say well i'll hang onto it for years, but if you want 3 months you can get something for htis price at 2x the perf and hold it for even more years.

Because maybe it's for work, or a vr edge case where you need to do something specific or you want premium-premium. I hear you. i like pc gaming too, What i don't like is getting price gouged. i compared this to an xbox there is basically no difference in most games. Nobody cares about 800 gpus as devs. Everyone talks about cyberpunk that's like the one case-- fine. I tried that too. I was disappointed with ray tracking. it's ok even a little better. is it 400 better, if I'm honest not really. It's not amazing. 4k, xbox does that. They use scalers. who cares it's cheap and it works why should I care how they get there. I only care about results.\n\nThis card isn't worth 600 at this point. I 've used it. It doesn't matter. I really see this as even a last mile. wait for the 4070 next whenever or 7700, 4080 if you must if nvidia wants to play games lets play games. just not the ones we should be playing. Or get it I don't really care. I'm just trying to cut though the hype. As always with amazon you get these one star reviews because someone got something defective or zero issues with the actual product, maybe a seller whatever, or you get a 5 star review because someone just paid 800 and they need to justify their consumerism exuberance.\n\nAll I'm saying is check your self before you click buy. Think hard about this it's, it s a big purchase, and it's not really going to change your life. There are cheaper alternatives.\n\nAll that said it really is built well. It's all metal. you don't need higher power limit unless your chasing a few percent and want to deal with the heat and nose. this one in particularly has a fantastic vrm. limited but little extra power, and a create cooler.

None of these are practical. they are luxuries at this point. 4080 may cost 100 more and be almost 2x the perf and will be around by December in all likely hood. what you are seeing is these aibs releasing things crap to good ad discounts to sell out of junk, so 12gb vents, gigabyte, now evga Asus and higher end stuff.

I just feel guilty having such a nice GPU! I'm not an avid gamer; I game casually. I don't do any sort of media creation that demands a powerful GPU, and I don't mine. Why then did I buy a new card?\n\nI had a GTX 970 that worked well for my needs, albeit the card was old. With GPU prices having fallen the past year, and having recently built a new computer, I was interested in upgrading my GPU. Mostly just for the sake of upgrading. $800 still seems like a hefty price tag for a GPU, but my justification is that this is an excellent GPU and has \"future proofed\" me for another 8-10 years.\n\nSo why did I buy it? The simple answer is this: the RTX 3080 is an excellent GPU and the time was right *for me* to upgrade now. So I did. I feel guilty, but it also feels great having one of the best graphics cards on the market. And it works splendidly.\n\nI debated between the 3080 and the 3070, as well as between the 3080 10GB and 12GB. The 10GB model is only a few dollars cheaper, so really why not spend the extra $20 to have the extra 2GB VRAM? The difficult decision came down to the 3070 vs the 3080. The 3080 is indisputably the \"better\" card, and so for the sake of tomorrow, I bought it today.\n\nThe build quality on this ASUS card is great. I don't compare a lot of graphics cards, so I can't say much. There's some sag, but my case has an anti-sag bracket, so that's minimized in real world application for me, but better frame design on ASUS's part should have made this point irrelevant in the first place. I like the clean look of the card. The RGB is not a selling feature to me, but its minimalism is chic and fits my style. It was nicely packaged, easy to access, and without a lot of trash fillers stuffed in the box.\n\nAll in all, this is a fabulous GPU and I recommend it. The price is high.

It got a little more stable with 22.8.1, but the control panel still kept crashing.\n\nThe RGB looks ok, not too candy-like - but MSI's software to control it is garbage that has no place on a well maintained system that is not only used to show off. Alternative software like OpenRGB, iCue or SignalRGB had trouble detecting and controlling the card properly.\n\nThe only upside I noticed is that the card is built like a tank. Despite its weight it seems to use its backplate as reinforcement to the PCB, which should help to reduce sagging. The box also contains an additional, inconspicuous bracket that can be used to further stabilize the card. Didn't really matter to me as I use a vertical mount, but it's good to see this issue covered.\n\nI ended up sending both cards back and eventually went with a water-cooled 6900 XT for $800, which I am much more satisfied with. The driver issues seemed to have gone away since the latest update to 22.8.1, so I assume they were not related to any hardware faults, but I can't say for sure."}, {"title": "Great Card", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2022", "text": "This card has kept up with all my current gaming needs on Ultra settings.

This is 10-15C cooler than the max GPU temp (Tmax).\n\nTEST ENVIRONMENT:\n\n- SMALL COMPUTER CASE with lots of air venting (a worst case case for noise)\n- NO OTHER FANS in the case other than CPU fan\n- GPU at 100% load\n\nRESULTS:\n\n(1)\n33%-50% fan speeds all result in 79C, nearly silent 2'+ away\n55% fan speed result in 78C, and still quiet enough for under desk\n65% fan speed result in 75C, Audible 4'+ away, OKish under desk\n75% fan speed result in 70C, Audible 4'+ away, audible under desk\n80% fan speed is MUCH noisier than even 75%\n\n(2)\nI CHOSE TO MOSTLY RUN AT 33% fan speed (lowest settable) since at 79C we are still well under the 82-87C goal. At that fan speed it is INAUDIBLE UNDER THE DESK.\n\n33% Fan Speed translates to 1,940-2,090 RPM.\n\nSide Note:\nI would think in a mostly enclosed case it would be mostly silent on desk at 33% fan speed.\n\n(4)\nDON'T use AUTO to set fan speed as it prioritizes temperature over any concern for noise. AUTO can result in extremely high fan speed (ex: 85%) even when entirely unnecessary.\n\nInstead use MANUAL or even better CUSTOMIZED.\n\nCUSTOMIZED is set using the free GIGABYTE AORUS engine application (it's quite simple to use). I set customized as follows:\n- 33% fan speed (lowest possible) until 82C\n- 55% fan speed 83C-87C\n- 95% fan speed 88C-100C\n\n(5)\nRemember that a video card pegged at GPU 100% load can generate different heat profiles depending on what it is doing, such as different games and workloads. It's not always the same heat profile even at a fixed GPU 100% load. Thus, 33% fan speed may or may not be adequate for your particular needs.\n\n(6)\nBased on all of this, if your new GIGABYTE GeForce GT 1030 card is quite noisy at low fan speeds like 55% fan speed then you may have a lemon and should exchange it. You will be doing GIGABYTE a favor, they have no desire that lemons make it to the customer.\n\nSPECIAL FAN SPEED NOTES:\n\nIn case max fan speed or fan speed % calculations change, here are the RPMs found associated with different % fan speeds on this card.\n\n% _____ RPM\n----------------\n33% ___ 1,940-2,090\n35% ___\n40% ___ 2,090\n45% ___ 2,250\n50% ___ 2,500\n55% ___ 2,750\n60% ___ 3,000\n65% ___ 3,250\n70% ___ 3,500\n75% ___ 3,750\n\nPART #2: WHAT'S THIS CARD BEST FOR?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's special about this card is how remarkably skinny and short it is given its graphics power (SINGLE SLOT, LOW PROFILE). This allows a whole different level of graphics power for many small cases that couldn't otherwise fit anything near its graphics capability.\n\nIf you have a bit more space, such as double-slot or standard profile height, you might consider instead using FANLESS GT 1030 options, or for a bit more money up the graphics power a bit and go for at least the GeForce GT 1050 level cards or its AMD equivalents.\n\nKeep in mind this card has 2 GB on it, which is plenty for many uses but can be quite limiting for some more demanding uses like video editing.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nBest Regards,\nNeil"}, {"title": "Decent budget card", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2022", "text": "Bought this for a used PC.

(Only needed a display output, really) It only has 2gb of vram, and in 2022 its a lemon of a card, really not worth the 35 watts it consumes. It did light gaming for a time, think 1280x720 resolutions mainly on low, nothing considered really \"good.\" Also this card lacks an NVENC encoder, so it can't even encode video. If for some strange reason you must have a GT 1030, I beg you to at LEAST get a GDDR5 variant of it, as the DDR3 and DDR4 variants of this card perform even worse... Basically this card is so budget you can expect it to last 2 years running mostly 24 by 7, and then the fan will die. Just get a GTX 1650 if you need a card with no power connectors, its so much better. But hey, at least that fan on this card was silent until it died, making a grinding noise that I can still hear from the server closet."}, {"title": "A Big Improvement for a Reasonable Price", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2020", "text": "There were some games I wanted to play on Steam, but with the standard \"HD graphics 4600\" on my computer, the motion was balky and choppy. My computer was a small form factor HP, so I was limited by 2 main constraints. The standard 240 watt power supply was an odd size, preventing me from upgrading it, and the case was small so I need a low profile graphics card. The Geforce GT 1030 proved to be the perfect solution. Its power draw was very low; it drew power only from the motherboard, meaning that no additional plug was needed to power it; and it was small enough to fit inside the case.\nI should note that I run an SSD (solid state hard drive) instead of the standard HDD, and this reduces the power use of the computer considerably. This power reduction offset at least some of the extra power drawn by the graphics card. I don't think that I would attempt this upgrade with a 240 Watt power supply and the standard HDD.\nInstallation was a breeze. Attaching the smaller bracket on the card and physically installing it in my computer took less than 10 minutes. I had difficulty getting the driver to download from the Gigabyte website, but the included CD worked fine. The included instructions are generic and of little help, but fortunately the process is fairly intuitive.\nYou should be aware that this video card does not have a VGA port. You will need either an HDMI or DVI cable to connect your monitor. This is clearly stated on the Amazon page, but somehow I failed to notice it.\nAfter installation was completed, the performance increase was impressive. To be sure, the graphics aren't perfect. Occasionally there is still the slightest amount of hesitation in some of the graphics. However, the games are now perfectly playable with minimal distractions. The cooling fan is audible but not at all distracting.\nWith a larger case and power supply, I probably would have paid the extra $80 or so to get a more powerful GTX 1650 with 4 GB instead of 2 GB. However, given the physical limitations of my system, I think that the GT 1030 gave me as much improvement as I can squeeze out of my tiny computer."}, {"title": "Worth the price.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2022", "text": "I bought this after seeing the price, it worked well.

I tend to play fairly easy-to-run games on the PC in question, but even still, the MSI R7 250 2GB DDR3 inside was struggling.\n\nFable Anniversary could barely pull down 30FPS on medium settings. Wolfenstein The New Order/The Old Blood would be at 25-30FPS on low/medium settings. Even Crusader Kings II, Hearts of Iron III/IV, and Stellaris ran at sub-60FPS on low/medium settings.\n\nI purchased the GT 1030 to remedy these faults, and boy, was I not disappointed. 60+ FPS on Fable Anniversary on max settings. Steady 55-60FPS on Wolfenstein on max (okay, very close to max) settings. Paradox games went from a 20-25FPS to well over 70. I was quite shocked by the latter.\n\nTo wrap up my review of its performance- let's talk over clocking. Once (basic) drivers are installed via the included CD, a built in clock control program is also installed. It is easier to use than Afterburner, having safe presets- but does not allow for as much control until specifically placed in \"professional\" mode. Otherwise, the clock speeds are just fine for a 69 dollar card. On top of that, the VRAM is DDR5- a massive upgrade for those still running DDR3 VRAM.\n\nAs to the more physical nature of the card- wow, is it tiny. Less than half the size of my replaced R7 250, probably a quarter of the size of the 1070 in my main computer. Far lighter as well.\n\nInstallation was simple, as it only draws power directly from the PCI slot/motherboard. Speaking of power- this thing barely draws any. Can't recall exactly, but I know that it's a minuscule amount. As long as you have a 300-350W power supply, you'll be fine.\n\nBe warned- given the size, this card only produces ONE DVI port and ONE HDMI port. That's it. Just something to think about. I was a bit surprised they didn't put a VGA slot on a card NVIDIA is touting as the answer to every budget gamer's needs- but I digress. I suppose even HDMI-sporting monitors/TVs are cheap nowadays.\n\nCard is whisper silent, although the first time I installed it, it spun hard and fast for a few minutes, and made considerable noise- don't freak out if that happens. She has great thermals, but I do have an overkill cooling setup in this PC, so results there are probably skewed for the average person who isn't obsessed with cooling.\n\nAnyways, a $69, low-profile, Pascal-based, NVIDIA GPU? It's not too good to be true. Give it a shot if you're on a budget, have power or size restrictions,or even if you're just an NVIDIA or GPU enthusiast. It won't replace your 1070, but it will definitely surprise you- especially given its small form factor and low power draw.\n\nJust a quick side note before I stop rambling- don't ask me how but- I'm pretty positive NVIDIA will be releasing a GT 1040 soon, perhaps by the end of the year.

After several years of insanely overpriced cards this is sadly about as good as it gets.\n\nPerformance is good, and it runs fairly cool which was a surprise. I mean, it better, the heatsink on this thing is massive. I have a 144hz 1440p monitor and for the vast majority of my gaming time I'm sitting right at 144 fps. I'm quite happy with that. I upgraded from a 5700XT which did fine, but rarely made it up to 144 fps in most games.\n\nI'm running with a 5800X and a bunch of fans off a Seasonic Platinum 750 watt PSU. Total system power draw under heavy load is in the low 600ish watt range. So as long as your PSU is good, 750 watts is fine.\n\nI'm also only using two power cables for it. I thought I had enough outputs for three independent cables from my PSU, but I only had two. So I'm using the pigtail ends to power two of the 8 pin connectors off one cable. It works fine. The total power that cable could theoretically draw is 300 watts, which is no problem for a decent PSU. And in reality the total power draw for the entire GPU usually sits around 300 watts, which is split across the three connectors up top, as well as up to 75 watts from the PCIE slot itself. So yeah, don't listen to the people who insist you must use three separate cables. I've run mine on benchmarks for over 30 minutes at 100% utilization, no issues.\n\nThe only downside I had was the shipping. Amazon actually shipped me an $800 GPU in a plastic bag!

The only games to use ray tracing well are cyberpunk 2077 and watchdogs 2.

AMD drivers have come a very long way.\n\nGPU core clock is usually around 2500mhz and VRAM is insanely fast at times reaching the same 2500mhz. Default fan profile is pretty quiet and not irritating at all, it can get up to around 2000rpm on the fans which is very audible especially since using a semi open case, if this was in an enclosed case would guess that it would be near inaudible. No coil whine on my unit (thank the hardware gods), power draw has reached up to 320 w, from what research has been done would need to unlock it to get upto the 400+ watt. Might try it at a later time but it's really not worth IMO for a few extra mhz handful of frames. Nice to have the option though.\n\nThe lighting is full RGB, comes default red. Do have to get the lighting app installed in order to change it, but after it's set it saves the setting on the hardware so can uninstall LED software after changing the color/effect which is awesome.\n\nLove being able to run everything around the same performance level as a RTX 3090 for $1k cheaper in today's wacky market.

Frame rates are right were I'd like to see them (well above 100FPS in most games even on ultra), and having proper variable refresh rate support is HUGE. On top of that, in games that support ray tracing, it does a good job. You do take a bit of a hit with Ray Tracing enabled, but not as big as you might expect given the hype from other manufacturers. When Ray Tracing is done well in a game, it adds so much to the experience.\n\nThe large cooler keeps the rather toasty GPU nice and cool, with the hottest part of the die topping out at a nice 69 Celsius (reported) with the fans barely spinning when I ran a stress test on my system (~25.5C ambient, Corsiar 5000D Airflow, positive pressure config, running Furmark and IBT simultaneously).\n\nAside from the wildly inflated price, there is one downside that may make or break purchasing this card for you: coil whine. I've heard people complain about coil whine before, but I've never experienced it in my own builds until now. This card has it bad. Fire up a game like Forza Horizon 5 and SCREEEEEEEEEEE. It wails at you like a banshee until you're actually in the game. I thought something was going wrong in my power supply, but nope, it's just the coils vibrating themselves to a potentially early grave.\n\nIf I have any warranty issues, I'll be sure to update this review.\n\nPros:\n\u2022 Very fast GPU\n\u2022 Lots of vRAM\n\u2022 Stays cool even with the fans on \"silent mode\"\n\u2022 Super easy to overclock with the Radeon software\n\nCons:\n\u2022 Coil whine out the wazoo in high frame rate circumstances (like the opening screens for Forza Horizon 5)\n\u2022 Inflated price (currently $1599, but it should be around the $1200 range based on the launch MSRP)\n\u2022 Requires a header connection to sync RGB\n\u2022 RGB Header is flimsy and the pins are super easy to bend\n\u2022 ARGB cable is way too short"}, {"title": "The facts.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2022", "text": "This thing is amazing. (Opinion). This card, the Ultimate, MSRP'S for $1599 (Fact) This is not a $999 Reference card. (Fact) This card has an XTXH Binned chip. (Fact) please stop reviewing cards negative Because you over paid or don't want to pay scalper prices. This is a disservice to reviewing any GPU for its performance. If you want to rate a $999 good GPU of any brand or manufacturer as a bad value because your paid $3000, please stop. The value of a card should always be based on the MSRP never what you decided to pay.\n\nNow if your read through that, this card is great. I personally don't have coil whine, or mine is not bad enough to notice. Power Colors custom cooler is genius. This air cooled card has taken everything I've thrown at it (I am not an extreme overclocker, though I do overclock) and had never averaged over 72c. AMD, needs to pay Power Color what ever money they want in this world and make this cooler an industry standard. I really can't say that enough. Good RTX lighting. (No it is not an Nvidia RTX card, it will never have RTX effects like an Nvidia card) If Ultimate RTX lighting is your go to thing. This won't be it. But still looks absolutely amazing. If you have to have DLSS. This doesn't have it. (Though I can not personally attest towards Super Fidelity FX.) I had a 2080 TI before this and never turned on DLSS. (Disclaimer: DLSS is an amazing technology)\n\nTLDR: Fast, Cool, Quality, Looks Amazing. Should you but it? This is a great card. It's worth whatever you feel is a fair price for this card.

The only concern I have is that the box\u2019s sticker seal was broken but everything is legit and I verified the product, so no issues but that is a bit odd. Other than those things, this thing is so awesome. Overclocked, not overclocked, doesn\u2019t matter.

One thing that helps is setting this card to the OC mode which makes the fan stay at a set speed. Other than the fan issue, which is hopefully something that can be fixed with firmware updates, this is a beast of a card."}, {"title": "Great card, reseller is reasonable, EVGA is something else", "rating": "3", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2021", "text": "The card is great and all, gouged price sure but hey what graphics card isn't?

The graphics card isn't compatible with any other forms of software like iCue or AuraSync so you have to use EVGA's Precision X1 software to fine tune the cards looks and performance.

When I purchased this product, Amazon guaranteed delivery on Sunday Feb. 6, 2022. On the 6th, I woke up to an email that it would be delayed until Monday the 7th. No problem, we had a blizzard and people have been digging out. BUT, it was delivered on Sunday and just left outside, in the freezing cold and snow, without me knowing or expecting it was going to happen. Luckily, a friend stopped in for five minutes, and by coincidence that's when the package was left in the cold and snow, so it wasn't there when he came up the porch, but it was there when he went down and my package got to me safely. The seller bears no responsibility for this, as it was fulfilled by Amazon, but for some reason, Amazon doesn't let us write reviews for the customer service, so here it is. You can do better, Amazon.\n\nAs for the product itself, it's not really as bad as my \"stars\" would suggest. It arrived in what appears to be brand new packaging. I can't find any evidence that the anti-static bag was ever opened before. I installed it in my aging Dell Inspiron 3700 (with an i5-8400, and 12GB of RAM) hooked it all up, turned it on, and after about 5 minutes of some installation process (at which time there WAS video) my screen automatically reverted to the display settings it had prior to the install, and it works just fine. I installed Nvidia GeForce and, after one more driver update it was over. The entire process was from start to finish was less than 20 minutes.\n\nThis was the first time I have ever installed a GPU, and I can only assume that that is EXACTLY how it is supposed to work. As for the value for money, NO GPU has a good value to money ratio. Crypto-miners and the pandemic have seen to that.\n\nAs for gaming, this just is NOT a card built to plays today's most advanced games. I got this card because PGA 2K21 can only track one profile at a time, so two people with two profiles need two copies of the game to track their stats in co-op. Now, my aging Dell could manage about 25 FPS in \"potato mode,\" a number that made it unplayable. With this card, on low settings (one step up from potato mode), this card and the i5 deliver 90FPS steadily at 1080p quality.\n\nThe problem there, is that 2K21 is really \"The Golf Club 3\" with 2K's marketing slapped on the box. As such, the entire install from Steam was just 6.6GB. And as every modern gamer knows, the 5-15GB game file size was lost to any game above the 'indie\" classification when the games went 4K. Which means that the game would have to still be in potato mode if 4K textures even existed in the files for processing.\n\nThe only other \"modern\" game I have on the Dell is Kerbal Space Program. And that, with low settings turned on, and the FPS locked to 80, this card and the i5 can get maintain a steady 60 in the assembly buildings and launchpad, and dropped into the 40 FPS range during the launches I tested. But that is normal. KSP can make even monster PC's cry for mercy if the user launches a big enough ship. The limitation there is far more CPU dependent than GPU dependent as the game tries to simulate physics, heat, and gravity calculations on hundreds of individual parts simultaneously.\n\nAs for video streaming, honestly, I don't see very much improvement over the streaming quality of just the i5, but there is no LESS quality to the streaming, and that's what matters. My monitor is a 32\" 1440p, with a 144 Hz refresh rate.\n\nI do, however, have a couple of issues with this card. On the product description page, there is clearly a picture of the various output I expected to find on this card. And if I remember right that picture had a display port, an HDMI port, a 24 pin DVI port, and a VGA port (I might be wrong about the VGA port). The card that arrived at my house, does NOT have either a VGA port or a display port. So, if your monitor has either of those, BUYER BEWARE!!! I was only ever going to use the HDMI port, so I'm not too fussed.\n\nMy bigger issue is the plastic shroud on the GPU itself. The card doesn't cover the same amount of area that the plastic shroud does, so I have several square inches of exposed plastic shroud inside my PC, acting as a \"bowl\" to catch any dust flying around. And while the Dell has a paper filter the covers the main air intake, and a sort of cone directing the CPU exhaust directly out into the room and that has kept the amount of dust inside my case to a minimum. But now there is the GPU fan sourcing air from an unfiltered area, and just exhausting the air inside the case. So, ALL bets are off as to how this plays out in the remaining life left in my aging Dell.\n\nThat is just BAD design all the way around. It uses more material than is strictly needed meaning the manufacturer is paying more than is strictly necessary for each card manufactured, and it CAN'T be good for the PC to have an actual dust catcher inside a machine that you work hard to keep dust free. And I can PROMISE the manufacturer, that if my aging Dell suddenly dies six weeks from now, I know EXACTLY who I will blame. I won't get a refund, but THEY won't get a return customer.\n\nAnd for that reason, ultimately, I will give this GPU a 3-star rating with a serious \"BUYER BEWARE\" due to the misleading product photos, as well as the poorly designed fan shroud."}, {"title": "Overall great value, but missing a 2nd HDMI out", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2022", "text": "This graphics card works well in our limited-power mini-tower.\n\nIt'd be perfect for our needs if it had a 2nd HDMI port, but a simple adapter cable did the trick since one of the two monitors we hooked up had that necessary DVI port as well as its HDMI port.\n\nI can recommend this card as a good performance/value graphics card for your limited-power computer."}, {"title": "Do you want an Nvidia account /", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2022", "text": "Received it in a timely manner from Amazon, that part went well.

The driver for the GTX 260 is not supported on recent kernels. This left me with the unaccelerated open source Nouveau driver, which rendered correctly, but performed poorly: browsers were no longer as responsive and games were very slow due to extensive software rendering to the hardware. 8 FPS in one of my 3D games, too jumpy for use.\n\nWhat a difference 11 years makes. Compared to the aged GTX 260, this entry-level board has similar specs, with some operations much faster. Although my old PCIe 2.0 motherboard runs at half the data transfer rates of the board's PCIe 3.0 interface, everything is snappy including first person games (running at 24-45 FPS), and I'm using the latest version 470 driver. Not bad at all.\n\n* CSM stands for Corporate Stable Model, \"Extended Longevity & Advance Swap Service\" reads the box.\n* The card has a big finned heat sink instead of a fan and cowl, making it silent. It is a full length card.\n* It is low profile, and comes with panel brackets for low profile and regular slots.\n* It is dual slot width, with the heat sink fins taking up the adjacent slot.\n* It does not come with a metal cover for the open panel slot aligned with the heat sink fins, so you'll need to find one of those to cover the hole if you replace a card that covered both back panel slots.\n* There are two display output ports: DVI-D and HDMI.\n* The HDMI also has an audio device on the card, which I have not tested.\n* The slow, unaccelerated, open source Nouveau Linux driver works out of the box.\n* The fast, accelerated, proprietary NVidia 470 X11 driver works well too.\n* Cards based on the NVidia GT 1030 chipset debuted at around $75 but the current pricing is about twice that due to parts shortages; I still think these are still a fair price.\n* NVidia's GT 1030 chip requires about 30 Watts of power.

I believe the issue most consumers are having with drivers is from older versions of drivers, thus I had no earlier versions and went straight to amd drivers and was a flawless transition. I can't really comment on what's it's like if you are upgrading from an older radeon gpu... but for someone who's thinking of switching from Nvidia to AMD I highly recommend. Amazing performance, nice temps, excellent software (infact I prefer AMD's software over nvidia much more user friendly). Granted I went from a potato of a gpu (MSI 1050ti) but getting literally 125% better performance. Example - was running Battlefield V at medium settings getting 60-70 fps. Now running Battlefield V Ultra settings getting avg 130-140 fps. If you want the most bang for your buck this is the one to go with. Very satisfied consumer.\n\n*update* - still very happy with this card for the price you pay you get really great frames without a doubt most cost effective card on the market.. if you want the 2080ti that's fine not gonna hate on them but you'll basically be paying $400.00 - $600.00 more (depending on model) for 10-15 extra frames per second in rare cases (very rare) an additional 20 frames per second. Now to some gamer enthusiasts that might be worth the extra money, but honestly hardly can tell the difference... if you don't believe me plenty of reviews and videos you can see that also prove the same point. This update is also to make people aware that yes there are issues at times with this card, but I noticed something very simple fixed all my driver issues and never realized my bios was out dated.. if you happen to be getting the kernal error report check your bios and make sure you have the latest version if not flash it, after I did that had 0 issues with the card and back to enjoying my games."}, {"title": "WOW", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2020", "text": "I upgraded from a 1660 super and man I didn't think it would make such a difference.

I know these are on different ends of the spectrum but yeah that is what I play lol. Anyways with the 1660 super with this set up I was getting anywhere from 130-200 fps on league at 4k maxed out settings at 100% utilization. Cod warzone at 1080p high settings getting around 80-105.

The only downside is temperature. AMD has the stock fan speed at 46%. That is not enough for demanding titles in my opinion. It kept the gpu temp around 80 to 85 but junction temp I saw as high as 107. I know AMD says 110 is fine but not for me. So I put fan speed to max out to 75-80% which does make it loud but temps for gpu at that point are around 72 and junction around 91. I will take that downside for what you get for the price. I cannot speak to longevity yet but so far I would highly recommend.\nEdit: I thought I would add as well I attempted to overclock through the amd software as well and set the memory clock, power limit, and base clock to maximum thinking \"oh AMD wouldn't put settings in it's own software that the card couldn't handle.\" I was wrong.

All cards are a bit noisy on load, this one is relatively quiet, but you'll need to play with headphones to actually not hear anything while gaming (fan speed can always be tweaked with Afterburner, tho).\nIf you're new to team red or to their new Navi architechture, you may or may not heared by now that they have several driver issues with their Radeon Software. These issues usually consist of black screens in game if the hardware acceleration is on, or if the 'enhanced sync' is on. To me, this is the most annoying experience with this card, but i cant stop myself from recommending it when it costs at least 100$ less than Nvidia's 2070 super, which is only marginally better than this card in terms of raw performance.\nUnfortunately, this card has no dual BIOS switch so you can't toggle between silent and performance modes. This isnt a real problem when it comes to noise levels, but it may be a disadvantage if AMD would want you to update the BIOS in the future, just like how they're telling us to do with the 5600xt series. A dual BIOS eliminates the worry of bricking the card if something goes wrong during a BIOS flash.\nBe mindful of the free game coupon you may get with this game (carefully read the item page to see if you're eligible, and compare with other manufacturers like Sapphire and Asus).

I built the machine with an AMD CPU and this GPU. I bought an additional GPU for myself as my previous Nvidia lasted about 5 years (with no issues of any kind), and I figured it was time for an upgrade from 4GB to 8GB - I was building a new computer anyway. The price point was better on this card at the time and various sources led me to believe AMD was comparable to Nvidia. My PC is an Intel i5, by the way. So here we are, with 2 of these GPUs and Borderlands 3 (BD3) as our inaugural game to play with 2 gamer friends online.\n\nRight from the get go, my wife\u2019s computer crashed with no discernible pattern while playing BD3. Sometimes the game lasted hours, others minutes. I confirmed overheating was not the issue using MSI Afterburner. I swapped the cards, and sure enough my computer crashed while playing BD3 and Civilizations 6; my wife\u2019s machine was fine with both games. I sent the defective card back to AMD, got a new one, and installed it in my wife\u2019s PC. The other card went back into my machine. I should mention that I also played Resident Evil 2 and 3, as well as Rise of the Tomb Raider with maxed out graphics. Everything worked just fine and I finished all of the game.\nSometime in June, the problems that led to this review begin to surface on my PC. While playing BD3, Civ 6 or World War Z, I would experience sporadic driver crashes that require a restart to continue playing. I looked online and the only solutions I found required changing BIOS setting. The changes weren\u2019t that bad as my motherboard is newer and had the settings as described. It worked for exactly 2 weeks.\n\nAs of today, BD3 crashes the moment I fire a weapon (and I\u2019ve made massive progress in the game), Civ 6 folds over any time after 2 hours of play (joyfully announced by a flickering screen, removal of all shadows, and the eventual freezing of everything, requiring a hard reboot). World War Z kicks the bucket whenever it feels like it.\nI have updated the drivers to the latest version, 20.8.3, to no avail. What are the odds that 2 identical purchases would have such defects so few months apart? I didn\u2019t look for date and lot codes of the cards so I cannot say if they came from the same batch. I don\u2019t even know if the manufacturers write them on the cards. But even if they did, what sort of lopsided quality assurance would let something like this pass? Where is the fault then, AMD making shoddy GPUs, Gigabyte with the subpar boards, or the software being poorly written by consultants or in- house? Either way, it should not be up to me to ask these questions. Things like this cannot go to market, no matter who manufactures them.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIn all honesty, Nvidia never gave me such grief. I\u2019ve never had to return any of their cards for any reason, and I\u2019ve used them for over 15 years in every computer I have ever built - MSI, Gigabye, EVGA, etc, it didn't matter. I\u2019ve burnt out 2 Nvidia cards with heavy gaming after years of use, not months. I have never had to change BIOS settings just to be able to play a specific game with Nvidia.

Someone received a working card and all the stars in the AMD universe aligned and gave them an awesome card and awesome gaming experience. The alternative is the cliche \"Returned it to Amazon and bought a 2070S\".\nSo seeing the review stars on this, I finally decided to pull the trigger and buy the last piece to my new pc. I set out in hopes to build a SFF PC to replace my XBOX One in the entertainment center and finally bridge the gap between my Laptops steam collection and my at home console gaming. With the price to performance at $420 this was an easy choice for awesome 1080 gaming and mild future proofing. Having always been for Team Green, I decided to branch over and give AMD a chance. I also assumed that being in late 2020, and the brink of the release of the 6000 series issues would be minimal at worse. That all driver issues would have been resolved. I was quite mistaken. Initially upon the very first boot, no issues, all was well and running. Once windows was installed, still no issues. I started updating drivers and went straight to AMDs website and downloaded the newest version of the drivers...this was at which point things started to go south. Adrenaline 2020 installed but once it opened I started getting random pixels changing colors on the black background of the software. After a restart, nothing had changed. I decided to ignore the small issue and download steam. Once I opened steam, just the opening pages was enough to crash the entire system and force it into a restart. From there forums led me to multiple installs and Uninstalls. I removed the current version of the drivers using DDU and AMD driver cleaner. And worked my way back through the available drivers on the AMD website doing a clean sweep between every driver. Forums, and hours of troubleshooting, updating Bios, adding a separate PCI cable for the 6 pin, and numerous attepts later i had come up empty. I then saw everyone referring to the older 19 series drivers and checked the Gigabyte website to see what they had available (on my phone). Went to download those drivers and before I could even get it to load the support page had another full crash and restart and finally had enough and called it. Hours of forums and troubleshooting, multiple crashes, and not even 10 seconds of game play (it would have to not crash long enough to get into the menu...which it didn't.) I finally started the return process with amazon, saw a deal at a Local store and ended up with the ASUS Dual 2070 Super for just 60 dollars more. I really held high hopes to be a lucky owner of a functioning 5700XT but it was not meant to be. Even if by some miracle if it had decided to work, my worry would be, for how long? Until the next driver update? Until Windows updates? Until my neighbor across the street sneezes? At $60 dollars more I chose to go with the more reliable card and plug and play. I hate to have given up, but a consumer shouldn't have to go out of their way to find every possible cause for why it isn't working fresh out of the box.

Switching applications using Alt+Tab while gaming would cause issues with Freesync or adaptive sync. Combined with Vsync it will lock your monitor to 144hz or whatever the refresh rate is available/configured but when switching applications then back to the game window it will lock the refresh rate at 60fps depending on the application used last. Wake from sleep would display colored dots all over screen. Temperature monitors like MSI Afterburner and HWinfo shows GPU temps above 87c and fan speed at 0%. This leads me to believe the GPU doesn't go idle when computer is in sleep mode causing the GPU to overheat. When restarting computer, same colored dots would appear and diagnostic beeps are heard several times indicating video card is not present. RMA was processed and exact same model was sent by Amazon the next day. The new video card was installed after running DDU in safe mode. It has the same exact issues as the first.

So I tried everything that would make it usually crash ( amd adrenaline over lay, show in game fps \"yep these simple things made my gpu crashes much more frequently before flashing the bios\" ) and no crashes occurred. finally working like proper gpu\n\nSo yeah if you want it to work properly then do the following steps:\nFresh install/update windows\nupdate ALL drivers\nFlash motherboard bios\nUpdate your case\nUpdate your led\nUpdate your credit card\nUpdate the shipping box\nUpdate your job\nUpdate your life\n\nThen it will work properly.\n\nalthough it runs hot (85-87 C) with the stuck fan curve but that's an easy fix with custom fan curve you can make it run pretty cool\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nHad to return it. kept crashing updated everything, fresh installed windows 10, re installed drivers, DDU in safe mode and reinstalled latest drivers (3 times) nothing works, it just keeps crashing plugged in my old GPU and everything worked smoothly. too early to buy this until AMD officially recognizes the black screen crashes & fixes it.

Built for the Future. No artifacts or flaws so far.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2019", "text": "I purchased this EVGA RTX2070 for my son's birthday - he's an avid gamer. He previously had an AMD R270 that was purchased 4+ years ago which was underpowered for current/recent games he would host. I researched various video card reviews. The early reviews (when this RTX card was initially was released in 2018) cast shade on the RTX series stating they are overpriced and that Ray Tracing is hyped. Ray Tracing is coming on now and will be more prominent in games. And, leaving Ray Tracing aside for those games that don't support it, this is still a powerful/quality video card. I wanted to purchase something built for the future with a good warranty. I choose EVGA due to their warranty and good support and product quality reputation. My son currently games at 1080p, says he can have all the visual goodies maxed out on various recent games. (NOTE / PERSPECTIVE: My son is not big on first person shooters anymore, just occasional FPS use, he's more into strategy games. I don't game anymore, I used to in a different life. : ) This 2070 card will support WQHD (1440p) gaming quite well. From the reviews I have read, at resolutions above1440p (i.e. 4K gaming) the RTX2070 performance is nominal, just enough/adequate. However, 4K gaming is nothing my son is interesting in. Now before I get a mountain of opinions, I will say for my son's needs and purposes this card is excellent. No hassles, no artifacts, high quality, high framerates. He is in happy hog heaven. The experience delivered to him is more than enough for his purposes. This will most likely meet his needs for at least 2 - 3 years. P.S. We are brand agnostic. My main PC has an AMD card in it and I would and will buy AMD again if it's the solution for my purposes. The AMD CPU releases are currently on fire. I will say my son was relieved - or it was a plus to him - to receive an nVidia card.\n\nOnly minor complaint: It would have been nice to have video cable or two included. We had to get in the car and drive to local Best Buy to purchase a Display Port cable. (I own a mountain of HDMI, VGA and DVI cables but have not needed DP yet and son's current Dell monitor doesn't support HDMI.) The new WQHD monitor he may get for Xmas will certainly support HDMI). Other than that, no complaints. I suppose unless you buy the uber deluxe cards you don't get a cable bundle.\n\nP.P.S. DRIVER ANECDOTE: Son's PC has Windows 10 OS. I had cautioned him to first disinstall the AMD video card drivers from his older hardware he was leaving behind before powering down and then advised to replace with a fresh download of latest nVidia drivers. (I was also willing to burn a disk of latest nVidia drivers for him). He waved off, didn't do that. I was expecting problems from this. But No! He boots PC up with new nVidia RTX 2070 card. It was flawless! He was able to begin using his setup immediately. The \"native\" nVidia drivers supplied in Windows 10 gave him a no drama experience and he could start using the PC and begin gaming. I was kind of surprised. In the \"old days\" that was a guaranteed recipe for problems. Your Mileage May Vary but that's what we experienced. I still encouraged him to obtain the nVidia site drivers \"to be sure\" but for now, things are fine."}, {"title": "Excellent card so far", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2019", "text": "I will start out by saying I am not the best person to review, I don't have tons of experience with other different cards. What I can say about this card is that so far it has met all of my expectations.\n\nMy first card that I purchased for my current computer was an rtx 2060 black from EVGA. I didn't do any research before I purchased it, I just saw it had a fair price and claimed to operate rather silently. It didn't. It was loud, and warm, resulting in dropped clocks (76 degrees during heavy load). This was probably a result of the one fan design, despite the rather large heat sink. For some people, the loud fans probably wouldn't be an issue, but with nearly everything else silent on my rig I found it to be annoying. It performed okay, it was just too loud, and from what I have seen a lot of the rtx 2060s run pretty warm resulting in increased fan use (noise). I was even considering liquid cooling the 2060 just to get temps, and therefore noise, down, but decided to instead return the card and get a card with good thermals to begin with.\n\nHaving not been satisfied, I checked reviews for the different 2070 models. After seeing that this was a no-frills card that managed to keep rather low temps, I was on board. At first, after installing, I was worried when I saw it idling at around 48 to 50 degrees, and I thought that furmark would push it up to 90. Nope, this gpu has fans that are completely off at idle, which is why it runs a little warmer than normal. This means no noise at all from the gpu\u2026 and you can even set a custom fan curve to have it run cool at idle if you wish. Idle temps don't really bother me. I shouldn't have worried about furmark, because the curve topped out at 65 degrees with silent case fans (noctua), and with a custom (still nearly silent) case fan setup I dropped a further 3 degrees to 62. These temps are with a front mounted radiator, by the way. Also, this was with a +200 on the core, +800 memory, 114% power limit, and 88 temp limit. That blew my rtx 2060 out of the water, and because the temps stay low this card boosted rather high and rarely dropped clocks during heavy gaming.\n\nNow, for the important stuff. I play some games 2k, some 4k, depending on the game. 2k this card is a winner. 4k I have run some older games at max or extremely high settings (Killing Floor 2 runs buttery smooth, so does GTA V). I don't have any newer games to test at 4k so I can't say how well this card does, but I'd assume that with concessions in your graphics configurations you could get a lot of them going well. I have a 4k monitor that runs at only 60hz refresh, so your mileage may vary. I find 60hz to be fine for casual gaming, but some people don't. I don't play many first person shooters so I don't need high refresh as much as I appreciate greater visual fidelity.\n\nIn any case, as I have seen reviews that this card may fail after a while, I may update this review. If I don't, awesome, this card rocks, and they have worked out their issues. For now, however, I am enjoying my new graphics card, and it is definitely worth the money. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good budget (at 500 dollars, it can be 100 or 200 cheaper than other rtx 2070s so I suppose that fits) rtx 2070 for their build. Great thermals, noise, and performance."}, {"title": "Good alternative to 1440p gaming, but not the 2080...", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2018", "text": "Alright fine... I'll review the card since nobody wants to go first. :)\n\nDecided to get this card due to its price point compared to the big brothers (2080 and 2080ti respectively). I don't think I'll be the first or last when it comes to this reasoning. The RTX 2080ti is just too darn expensive and the 2080 is literally $300 more. I mean wow... just wow! Even at $570 the 2070 is a bit questionable. However, this card comes with a rigid back-plate and MASSIVE cooler/heatsink. In fact, the 2070, 2080 and 2080ti Ultra editions have the same huge heatsink. I know many of you might be wondering if the \"Ultra\" edition is worth it. YES! The noise/sound is significantly lower when on full load and well worth the extra $50-$70 you'll shell out. Do it!\n\nThe 2070 is a good alternative to 1440p gaming, but I want to make it very clear. This card does not have the horsepower of its elder brethren. Don't get me wrong, this card will pull it's own weight and is much more justified in the price point than others; however, when compared to even a 2080 it's rightfully not in the same category. There is a noticeable difference between the two. I know what you're saying... there should be with a $300 difference in cost, but if you're looking for REAL power you may want to shell out the extra dough and go for the 2080. Wondering what this guy is talking about? I have both the 2070 and 2080... tested them both and the 2080 has raw power and is absolutely the perfect match for 1440p (144hz) gaming. So hard to justify the extra cost, but worth it (Figuratively speaking).\n\nThe cost of the 2080 and 2080ti are simply a joke when you think about it, but if you're looking to game hard they are just better cards and NVIDIA/EVGA know it. I cannot tell you how beautiful and smooth Battlefield 1 runs with the 2080 in 2K. I know what you're thinking... the 2070 is just as good; it's just simply not! Yes, it will run things nicely and look fantastic... but you must understand the shear power isn't on par with the 2080 boys. Take that for what you will in a review format.\n\nThe 2070 would be hard to justify for 1080p gaming as it's a beefy card. Instead, it's a good alternative to 1440p (No way it can handle 4k at high res). Notice I said a \"good\" alternative and not great to 1440p. The 2080 (Or old 1080ti) is the absolute perfect match for 2K (1440p/144hz) gaming and could do a decent job with 4K. However, I think we'll all agree the only way to play true 4K gaming is with the almighty 2080ti.\n\nFinal thoughts... the 2070 is a great card all around. It will draw far less power than the 2080. On full load I never got above 63c (Compared to 72c with the 2080). If you're a true gamer, you're probably not too worried about power draw, but it's good to have this knowledge as power = heat. You'll sacrifice 20-30fps in most games when matched up against the 2080. Is that worth $300? You'll have to decide that for yourself. Just keep in mind you're making an investment here and if you're looking to future proof your computer...\n\nI hope this helps anyone on the fence wondering if the jump to 2080 is really worth it? Hard to justify with the cost... it really is. However, if you're a true gamer and want the best \"experience\" it just might be worth it to bump up to the 2080. :)"}, {"title": "Potential to be game-changing but not quite there yet", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2019", "text": "I'll jump right in. The RTX line is marketed as having distinct cores for both ray-tracing and artificial intelligence. This is a great design element. However- contrary to Nvidia's CEO- this functionality is not merely \"turned on\" at a whim. Game developers must use the new tools provided to them by both Nvidia and Microsoft to make full use of the Turing architecture. At the same time, they still must keep their games performant across as many devices as possible. Remember, hardly anyone has an RTX card. There's little incentive for game developers to rapidly adopt a potentially locked-down and proprietary technology. Nvidia may be forced to make their tools more open and transparent in the distant future if they wish to remain competitive.\n\nTherein lies the problem. There are very few current titles that utilize their RTX and DLSS cards, and the ones that do aren't necessarily stable. In 10 minutes of research you may read about Battlefield V's limited and quirky support for ray-tracing. Owning this card will allow you to run ray-tracing on 'low' in BFV. Yes: 'low' is the recommended setting for a $500+ retail card with both a 2050 and 2060 lined up for future release. I gave ray-tracing a go and while it looks O.K (yep, just O.K) a cataclysmic decrease in frame-rate manifested. This functionality is not ready for prime-time: period. Here's how 2018 should have ended in a better timeline:\n\n* Nvidia should have kept Turing in development for another 8-12 months, working closely with game developers on current and future titles to fully utilize their new APIs and toolset\n* Nvidia should have maintained production of the Pascal series, which is a wonderful, versatile architecture and arguably their best work to date\n* EA should not have rushed their flagship RTX game BFV, which has manifested as negative marketing for Nvidia\n\nAlas, Turing cards were released prematurely. Hardly any games fully use their functionality and Nvidia's brass runs the company like Google and Apple now- aiming for ever increasing profits with little to no risk. Reality has bit them hard.\n\nBy the time RTX is \"optimal\" and developers have been caught up to speed, there may be a new series of graphics cards available for greater consumption. This includes cards produced by AMD, which has staged a comeback in the graphics arena. For this reason, if you're interested try to get an RTX on sale.\n\nWith that said, performance of my RTX 2070 is solid. It's a respectable card. It can keep BFV (no RTX) with my GSYNC monitor at a stable framerate between 80 - 100 fps. Older games work fabulously. The card is a bit large; make sure you have the clearance. The various models listed here are mostly differentiated by the size of the heatsink. There is some silicon binning going on but it is unclear how much that matters for this particular lineup; the heatsink is the primary differentiator. I would only grab RTX cards on sale at the moment, especially considering AMD is staged to release a new card sometime this year. Temperatures are somewhat hot but fairly reasonable. I'm seeing 60-68 degrees C under load during extended BFV multiplayer. Airflow is paramount with these cards as they critically rely on the heatsink, and the default fan curves tend to be very modest (to both reduce noise and prolong lifespan).\n\nTLDR\n* Good card overall, but marketed technology is not ready for showtime. Hardly any games fully utilize the architecture of distinct RT and AI cores. Current RT support is wonky and underwhelming. Consider picking up on sale.\n* Runs hot relative to Pascal. Avoid packing in a small and/or poor airflow case. Tweak fan curves (for both card and case) as needed.\n* Large.

The card performs well enough to be as good as the GTX1080 or better but I can still get a GTX1080 for about the same price. The thing is, the RTX2070 does NOT have NVlink nor SLI, which is a bummer but then not all games will run SLI. I know which game does use SLI and I played them well with the previous generation. With the RTX2070, I will only need one card for 1440p with decent performance. So basically, it will lose out to the GTX1080 with SLI. So I'm not thrilled about that. Also, I gleamed at some benchmark that suggested that there is NO difference using SLI or NVLink on RTX cards. Using RTX2080 with NVLink does NOT have an advantage over 1080Ti with SLI (other then it being already slightly faster by itself). Not sure if this is really true. Maybe someone can shed more light on this. Anyway, this a good card because it is an EVGA XC card (XC Ultra is even better), which is by itself very well made and at this price worth getting. There are well-designed heat sinks and two metal plates which is great for cooling. So very glad it is EVGA (this is my 4th EVGA card).\n\nThe second part is that I wish to use it as machine learning that can make use of the FP16 that the Pascal gen does not seem to have. Confusing benchmarks at different sites suggested that the RTX didn't have much or any advantage over the 1080Ti that I wish it would be because of the FP16. Apparently, the benchmarks are more about FP32, so again, there's not much I should be happy about having FP16 UNTIL the FP 16 and Tensor Cores are fully made use of. The FP16 codes are few and far between other than benchmarks. Maybe I'm new. I wanted to get the RTX2080 or RTX2080Ti to use the NVLink but according to a site that has tested NVLinks, it works like SLI BUT not in TCC mode which allows 2 linked cards to share memory, effectively doubling the size in a high bandwidth bridge. So using it for Rendering is pretty much no advantage over the 1080Ti unless the Raytracing cores are fully utilized. When that happens, you will wish that you can use the cards in TCC mode when you run out of memory because the scene is big!\nThe infinite number of Ray Tracing cores will not help because it will most likely run out of memory with big scenes and you do not want to just do little small scenes like a hobbyist (there are setups with 8x1080Ti for GPU Rendering). AMD VEGA FE (16GB) with HBCC uses available DDR4 RAM. Not as fast but better than crashing when running out of memory. There are Rendering engines that can do distributed GPU loads but through the PCIe bus (much slower than the High Bandwidth link). Anyway, this is not PCI-E 4.0. Even if it is, a single NVLink will have the same bandwidth.\n\nSo that's about it. It is still a really good card regardless. IF by any chance NVLink is enabled in TCC mode in the future, I'll think about getting a few more of the RTX2080Ti."}, {"title": "Easy Overclock and a free extra USB controller for my Oculus Rift Sensors (or USB Hub)", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2019", "text": "Got mine OC'd to a stock 1080Ti with the built in(to EVGA Precision) automatic overclocking software.

So now not only can I plug stuff into my USB ports (glorious controllers and bluetooth devices ;u; ) but I can also tell that my sensors were fighting for bandwidth because it seems that the tracking is better to boot! (:\n\nYou'll notice that I seriously just spent my entire review up until this point praising the fact that this has a \"built in Inatek USB HUB\" and that's because it's kind of the only thing it has over a GTX 1080 Ti (and my micro atx motherboard didn't have a PCIE Slot which I didn't find out about until AFTER I ordered the USB Hub >.< ). RTX isn't here yet, DLSS is clearly and obviously worse than current AA solutions, and there's no guarantee that you'll get a GPU capable of overclocking like mine did (while STUFFED in a small case that isn't supposed to be able to fit this card and fans pressed up against the bottom of the case which has a PSU blowing hot air + an overclocked R5 2600 blowing hot air right next to it and TERRIBLE ventilation in this cheap case.. you get the idea).\n\nI recommend, quite frankly, to either get a 2080 if you want performance, 1080 Ti / AMD's new GPU for this price, or a 2060 if you desperately need RTX but don't want 1080 (maybe 1080 Ti) performance. This card is priced weirdly is what I'm getting at. It can't do RTX well enough for most gamers to love considering it can do 4K at ultra settings OR pretty puddles. A 2060 would be a far better choice for most prosumers not planning on getting into VR and a 2080 is so much better than this that I can't imagine why one wouldn't upgrade to it unless you're like me and only play VR games and develop games / create CG in your spare time / hobby.\n\nI hope that wasn't too rambly.

I must say though While i was playing rise of the tomb raider the game ran EXTREMELY well at full setting. I had no inclination that it was going to crash before it did. no screen tearing no jitters. it just ran perfect. The bench mark tool in ROTR got an average FPS of 55 at fully maxed out settings with DX12 on which i think is pretty respectable.

I am actually an illustrator and put this into my new Quad desktop.\n\nUnlike the Smart Buy version which is for HP machines only - otherwise you'll break the warranty if you install it on a non HP machine, the PNY also comes with an additional VGA adaptor cable for your cable along with an HDMI to DVI and another adaptor for VGA.\n\nSetup on the motherboard was easy, it has an SPIF you can hook up, but this thing needs no extra power and will easily fit in your CPU.\n\nThere is only one issue I have for this card is that if you want to register the card, you'll have to make sure to get the serial number off the card first, BEFORE you install it, or make sure you have a chasis that's somewhat easy to take off without issues. I find it somewhat irritating to have to look for a serial number when I already have the card installed so I can register for warranty. I'm installing the card, it's not like it's easy to see or readily available. Even WD got smart and has a utility that let me get serial number info since ...well I installed it into the computer already. Granted the serial # is on the outside edge of the card...but still.\n\nI don't recall any other issues though I'm am a bit put off by \"universal manuals\" Manuals that really aren't specific to the card you have installed in case you have questions. This throwing of Asterisks around because someone doesn't feel like making a paper manual for people purchasing the card and making sure there are no issues before installation is a bit annoying.\n\nDon't you get tired of ** Varies on the Model when you aren't sure which model those pretty asterisks are referring to?\n\nReally somewhat minor though, since it's really about the performance of the card.\n\nPersonally I find the packaging for this card a bit extreme, since it's mostly Empty box. I'm referring to manufacturer packaging, not Amazon's packing. If they're trying to go green with manuals, they can do the same with the box. It really wasn't made to protect the card anyways.\n\nOther than that, again this is a budget card, low end for CAD and 3D artists, but I also noticed it does some nice handling of Adobe Photoshop CS4's layers too. It works fine for CS4 if anyone is curious."}, {"title": "Great card, great price!", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2010", "text": "I needed to upgade my computer to have a graphics card that had open gl.

I\u2019ll start by saying that I originally bought this just as a \u201ccheap\u201d place holder for my new build until Big Navi was released. The reviews on it aren\u2019t great but most of them just complain that the price is too high. I can kind of agree with this because the next step up is the 5600XT at $100 or less extra and the performance from the 5500 to the 5600 is night and day. But that\u2019s not to say the 5500xt isn\u2019t a good GPU. It got my 1080p gaming done at over 60FPS in most titles on max or near max settings. This is definitely a 1080p card. But it can perform somewhat at 1440p if you\u2019re willing to tinker with some settings.\n\nOver all I think this is a decent buy for anyone looking for a very good and cheap 1080p experience. Anything above 1080p and you\u2019ll want to move up to the 5600xt or 2060 depending on if you\u2019re an AMD or Nvidia person respectively.\n\nI got this card for $200 new and that\u2019s probably the max I would spend on a 5500xt 8GB. Anything higher and you may as well move up to the 5600xt.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve had two AMD cards since August (5500xt and 5600xt) and I\u2019ve never had any driver issues at all.

The biggest surprise for me though was just how quiet this card is! Even under 100% load the fan is so quiet that I can\u2019t even hear it.\n\nOverall an excellent budget card for 1080p and multiple monitors that I would recommend to anyone. I know that some people (and myself temporarily) were put off of this card after looking at the benchmarks, where it only fared marginally better than the 580/590, but when it comes down to it the lower power consumption is 110% worth it.

As an example I was playing Doom Eternal at 1440p with stable FPS above 60 even during heavy action.\n\nIf you are really wanting to play everything in 4k this card might not quite get you there. As a 1440p card though you cannot beat this price point. I highly recommend for this level.\n\nThe HDR on the card is ok. This I don't fault as much with the card as the software trying to use it.

When I purchased this product, Amazon guaranteed delivery on Sunday Feb. 6, 2022. On the 6th, I woke up to an email that it would be delayed until Monday the 7th. No problem, we had a blizzard and people have been digging out. BUT, it was delivered on Sunday and just left outside, in the freezing cold and snow, without me knowing or expecting it was going to happen. Luckily, a friend stopped in for five minutes, and by coincidence that's when the package was left in the cold and snow, so it wasn't there when he came up the porch, but it was there when he went down and my package got to me safely. The seller bears no responsibility for this, as it was fulfilled by Amazon, but for some reason, Amazon doesn't let us write reviews for the customer service, so here it is. You can do better, Amazon.\n\nAs for the product itself, it's not really as bad as my \"stars\" would suggest. It arrived in what appears to be brand new packaging. I can't find any evidence that the anti-static bag was ever opened before. I installed it in my aging Dell Inspiron 3700 (with an i5-8400, and 12GB of RAM) hooked it all up, turned it on, and after about 5 minutes of some installation process (at which time there WAS video) my screen automatically reverted to the display settings it had prior to the install, and it works just fine. I installed Nvidia GeForce and, after one more driver update it was over. The entire process was from start to finish was less than 20 minutes.\n\nThis was the first time I have ever installed a GPU, and I can only assume that that is EXACTLY how it is supposed to work. As for the value for money, NO GPU has a good value to money ratio. Crypto-miners and the pandemic have seen to that.\n\nAs for gaming, this just is NOT a card built to plays today's most advanced games. I got this card because PGA 2K21 can only track one profile at a time, so two people with two profiles need two copies of the game to track their stats in co-op. Now, my aging Dell could manage about 25 FPS in \"potato mode,\" a number that made it unplayable. With this card, on low settings (one step up from potato mode), this card and the i5 deliver 90FPS steadily at 1080p quality.\n\nThe problem there, is that 2K21 is really \"The Golf Club 3\" with 2K's marketing slapped on the box. As such, the entire install from Steam was just 6.6GB. And as every modern gamer knows, the 5-15GB game file size was lost to any game above the 'indie\" classification when the games went 4K. Which means that the game would have to still be in potato mode if 4K textures even existed in the files for processing.\n\nThe only other \"modern\" game I have on the Dell is Kerbal Space Program. And that, with low settings turned on, and the FPS locked to 80, this card and the i5 can get maintain a steady 60 in the assembly buildings and launchpad, and dropped into the 40 FPS range during the launches I tested. But that is normal. KSP can make even monster PC's cry for mercy if the user launches a big enough ship. The limitation there is far more CPU dependent than GPU dependent as the game tries to simulate physics, heat, and gravity calculations on hundreds of individual parts simultaneously.\n\nAs for video streaming, honestly, I don't see very much improvement over the streaming quality of just the i5, but there is no LESS quality to the streaming, and that's what matters. My monitor is a 32\" 1440p, with a 144 Hz refresh rate.\n\nI do, however, have a couple of issues with this card. On the product description page, there is clearly a picture of the various output I expected to find on this card. And if I remember right that picture had a display port, an HDMI port, a 24 pin DVI port, and a VGA port (I might be wrong about the VGA port). The card that arrived at my house, does NOT have either a VGA port or a display port. So, if your monitor has either of those, BUYER BEWARE!!! I was only ever going to use the HDMI port, so I'm not too fussed.\n\nMy bigger issue is the plastic shroud on the GPU itself. The card doesn't cover the same amount of area that the plastic shroud does, so I have several square inches of exposed plastic shroud inside my PC, acting as a \"bowl\" to catch any dust flying around. And while the Dell has a paper filter the covers the main air intake, and a sort of cone directing the CPU exhaust directly out into the room and that has kept the amount of dust inside my case to a minimum. But now there is the GPU fan sourcing air from an unfiltered area, and just exhausting the air inside the case. So, ALL bets are off as to how this plays out in the remaining life left in my aging Dell.\n\nThat is just BAD design all the way around. It uses more material than is strictly needed meaning the manufacturer is paying more than is strictly necessary for each card manufactured, and it CAN'T be good for the PC to have an actual dust catcher inside a machine that you work hard to keep dust free. And I can PROMISE the manufacturer, that if my aging Dell suddenly dies six weeks from now, I know EXACTLY who I will blame. I won't get a refund, but THEY won't get a return customer.\n\nAnd for that reason, ultimately, I will give this GPU a 3-star rating with a serious \"BUYER BEWARE\" due to the misleading product photos, as well as the poorly designed fan shroud."}, {"title": "Overall great value, but missing a 2nd HDMI out", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2022", "text": "This graphics card works well in our limited-power mini-tower.\n\nIt'd be perfect for our needs if it had a 2nd HDMI port, but a simple adapter cable did the trick since one of the two monitors we hooked up had that necessary DVI port as well as its HDMI port.\n\nI can recommend this card as a good performance/value graphics card for your limited-power computer."}, {"title": "Do you want an Nvidia account /", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2022", "text": "Received it in a timely manner from Amazon, that part went well.

Bought this GPU for a DELL XPS 8900 i7-6700K Skylake CPU (yes, for 8900 NOT 8920 or 8930 or any other 89xx) and I have to say It was a bit risky thinking the GPU wouldn't take, but it did. It fits perfect and doesn't overlap on the 2240 M.2 SATA SSD (See photos). After installation NVIDIA program recognized the GPU and updated the software automatically. I'm not using this for games but I am using DreamWeaver, Photoshop, Illustrator etc... as well as ZOOM for online college courses and a couple of other graphics demanding programs. I didn't have to mess with or update the BIOS, it was simply plug and play. Temperature wise it stays pretty cool. The only modification was having to exchange the original GPU bracket with this 1030 bracket. It worked out fine.

I paired this with a Budget ASRock B450m mother board with a Ryzen 3700x processor, and 16GB of RAM clocked to 3200 mHz. It supports media up to 4k no problem and playback is excellent, no stutters or skips. It does have HD audio output through HDMI up to 7.1 surround and can support Dolby Atmos if your audio system has that feature. This card suits my needs quite nicely for my media center PC. I don't do a lot of gaming but what I have played has been ok. Fornite, Resident Evil: Biohazard, and Call of Duty would all play at 1080p at around 60 FPS which is certainly playable. The GPU would bottleneck as it is just not powerful enough for GPU intensive games. For being passively cooled you need good airflow, I found that the card would not really get above 50 degrees C when gaming, and hovers in the mid to low 30's when playing back media. I overpaid for this card because of the GPU market right now, but it is a decent little card that doesn't draw a lot of power, so almost any system can use it without an issue(it is powered directly from the motherboard, no external power to plug in).

Seriously, if you're running on an old card or onboard video and having problems with gameplay with older or semi recent games, this may be a good choice for an upgrade. It is DX11 compatable so that's a thing. For a gamer on a budget it is amazing. I read some other reviews that said it wont run crazy heavy stuff or things at max settings, but if you are on a budget you probably wont be paying a crap ton of money for the latest and greatest. 10/10 from me! Great value for the easily accessible price, which ,at the time of this review, was about $150ish American. Something to keep in mind is that it may have an issue fitting in thinner PCs due to the MASSIVE heatsink. It fit in my pc just fine and I have a smaller hp \"compaq.\" Just watch for wire and make sure you aren't going to crush anything.\n\nIt comes with the standard size fixture attached but a smaller one in the box and they are easy to swap out just three little screws and your good.

This card is solid as a rock - it provides good performance on the desktop and acceptable gaming. If your looking for a 4k card - yeah this isn't it - but it is a good hdmi capable card and does what you ask of it. So while I say this is a great card it is from some sad experiences - I originally tried ASUS ROG STRIX-RX460-4G-GAMING card first. It worked a couple months - then died. Sent back to Asus who sent another in a couple months it died. Next tried a XFX Radeon RX 560 4GB DDR5 with the same sad results. In a couple months it flakes out. I 'think' the problem is with the fan not engaging and while in both cases neither Asus nor XFX provided software to throttle up the fan I find it curious that this card (which doesn't even have a fan) comes with software to guess what - throttle up the %*$()%* fan! So you've been warned honestly just stick with nvidia chips. Even the AMD driver testing is done on the I7 not a AMD machine - check their own notes in driver update notes (I am rolling a fx8300) AMD is pushing a lot of things to market - not particularly ready - not particularly in synch with their vendors and it shows. XFX is a great card maker I have a R9 and R7 card both work great. So it isn't them - learn from my pain and it will be worthwhile. I did order a Saphirre 550x at one point that did not work day 1. Again I suspect this is a hole between AMD and the card maker more than the card makers issue. I set it back same week. If they ever get the drivers and software worked out they will be good cards - but the crashing was so bad I had to reinstall windows it corrupted the FAT table. Yes that bad.

I went back into my PC to make sure the card was seated properly, it was, but I noticed that the heatsink was pressing up against a multi-wire plug on the motherboard (the firewire plug). Its smashing the actual wires. If it was just the non-heatsink portion of the card, it wouldn't be a big deal, but because the heatsink gets hot, it could potentially melt those wires.\n\nI'm leaving my review as four stars because I don't know if the problem of re-booting my PC is due to the GT 1030 overheating or the wires it's smashing, because otherwise, the card may be ok.\n\nI guess I'll order a card with a fan, like Gigabyte GT 1030 OC via Amazon.

I found that the card met my needs exactly and allowed me to play some more intense games without crashing. However, I started having issues with the previous card and I found that those issues almost exclusively took place when the card's fan started. After some research, I came to the conclusion that my itty-bitty power supply was the culprit, and not only that but the manufacturer had intentionally created the power supply so it couldn't be easily upgrade and fit into the case. So I did some more research and found this exact same card, but with no fan and a larger heat sink. For some computers, the heat sink might be so large as to get in the way of other card slots, but for me, I have had NO ISSUES at all, and it works great in my computer for its games.\n\nUpdate: I tried pushing the video card a bit to see how it would function. After an hour or so of heavier than usual graphics playing, the video started to flicker like it was about to go out. I suspected something like this might happen and do not blame the good quality of the card. The video card ends up with the heat sink in my PC facing downward and air probably doesn't flow well.

I will \"try\" to keep it short\n\nEVGA in the GPU industry is usually regarded as a top tier brand and this card is no different, it provides stable great gaming experience with great temperatures. The overhead for overclocking seems to be decent but as of this writing I didn't fully explore that yet.\n\nIf you are considering it for RTX I greatly recommend it but under the following circumstances, for now I only tested it on Battlefield V (Max RTX, Max Graphics) and it provides a stable 60 FPS experience on 1080p. Just to be clear 1080p while using this card is a great overkill.\n\nI opted for it as I like to record gameplay and upload also there is a good chance I will be upgrading my monitor within this year. so I wanted to make sure I don't get any issues while recording. This is how I personally was able to justify paying such a premium.\n\nI'm sure this card can pull 1440p easily with RTX ON with frames somewhere around 80 FPs\nwith RTX Of however you can expect to be able to run 4K Games at 60 FPS stable without any issues\n\nThe following is just my humble opinion:\nIf you fall under any other category, other than what I mentioned above, I strongly suggest you look for more reviews or wait this one out (assuming you don't care about RTX) based on your personal situation. For example playing 4K with RTX on Max using this card isn't going to happen you will need to get the 2080 TI for that. If you have a monitor with anything higher than 120 FPS like the 144, you should also consider the 2080 TI.\nFrom what I gathered the new RTX 2060 Lineup should be able to get a 60 FPS gameplay at 1080p with RTX settings at Medium so this could also be an option for you if you are a 1080p gamer.\n\nThe new RTX Lineup is rather complicated more than usual but due to that complication it also offers a great variety of options. That's why my final advice would be to take your time and read/watch reviews, benchmarks, and study your specific case carefully (Your monitor Resolution & Frames, RTX Settings you want, possibility of upgrading your monitor in the close future).\n\nInternational Shoppers rejoice:\nIf you live in Kuwait I'm guessing the rest of the gulf as well, Amazon now ships directly to Kuwait in record times, Door to Door with full tracking and decent fees (make sure its Amazon Global Service).

Then again, it does something I've never achieved before with any other GPU....\n\nMy objective for my new PC was total fan-less silence when I'm not gaming...and relative quiet even when I do.\n\nThe huge heatsink on this EVGA GPU (along with a 360mm Corsair AIO for my conservatively overclocked i7-9700k) are the key elements which allowed me to do this. The radiators are so massive that the entire systems stays very cool even without the fans spinning.\n\nI installed it all inside a roomy Define R6 along with a few slow and quiet 140mm fans for those moments when the GPU/CPU combo are heavily active, and honestly even then...under heavy load...it's still much quieter then my previous machine was idle.\n\nI should also note that I did NOT install the EVGA Precision X control software when I first installed the card, intending to later as I have with all my previous EVGA cards...but this one has run so flawlessly that I haven't even bothered. The stock curve on mine doesn't seem to spin up fans until ~60c, and I can see via HWMONITOR that my card never even approaches near those temps until I game. Even then though the fans are large enough, and the rpm's slow enough, that I have to put my ear up against the case to hear anything.\n\nPerformance wise, it's not quite the quantum leap that I was expecting from my previous GTX980...it feels twice as fast, and my benchmarks more then confirm so, but I expect that when I skip a generation. I have noticed and appreciated the additional memory (8GB vs 6GB in my old 980) allowing me to load more highly textured and detailed settings at 4K resolutions when I play TW:Warhammer. That game sometimes maxed my 980's memory out and would \"swap\" if you will to my machines primary memory, which sometimes resulted in buggy behavior."}, {"title": "Purchased FTW3 April 8th, 2019 @ $1,300. 2 1/2 years later it still bangs hard in a second PC.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2021", "text": "I bought it as an upgrade to my old Alienware Area-51 desktop (the triangle shaped one) I bought in 2015.\nIt performed admirably, and really opened my computer up to a ton of high end games at great quality.\n\nI have since moved on and built a tower from ibuypower.

I read a review stating that the Evga XC Ultra was performing as good as the founder edition but with less heat and noise so I ordered it and I could not be happier. This beast can run everything you throw at it without any problem. For instance, my Gigabyte GTX 1080 was having a hard time to go above 90 fps at 2K and ultra settings in Battlefield V but this one runs it at above 120 fps most of the time. If I enable ray tracing and set it at ultra the frame rate drops at 70 fps but it's still very smooth and the images are beautiful.\n\nMoreover the card temperature never goes above 65C and is always dead silent even with a more aggressive fan speed curve set in Precision X1. Speaking of Precision X1, I managed to do a decent overclocking with this easy to use software. To be honest I prefer MSI afterburner but to make sure I have the optimal stability I am using the Evga software (for now) and it's pretty good too. The RGB control is also easy with the software and it looks nice in my case (see picture).\n\nOf course if someone is struggling to pay his rent I would say stick with your GTX 1080 but if you have the money, a powerful enough CPU and want a substantial fps boost I highly recommend this GPU."}, {"title": "Absolute Beast", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2020", "text": "I bought this card back in 2019 but I think after running this thing pretty hard every single day I need to review it and give some insight.\n\nThis thing is an absolute monster.

I run a 1440p 144hz monitor as my main and 2 4K monitors as my second and third monitors and it absolutely handles everything I\u2019ve ever thrown at it.
