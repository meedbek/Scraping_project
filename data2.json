It outperforms it's competitors and some of the Nvidia vanilla cards without demanding a new power supply, assuming you have a 400W or above already. Unlike the original 1650 and lower models, this requires a 6-pin PCIe connector, which isn't asking much considering it being just a bit above the limit where you wouldn't need one, this card does however run hot, was nearing 80C on Ultra playing Dead By Daylight (thanks again to Asus for the free game back in 2016 from my 950 mini purchase), I did not pay attention to the other settings, just switched to Ultra and started playing, it's not perfect, however, even on ultra I was still getting noticeably better performance than my now broken Zotac 1050 Ti that was struggling on medium, that shows the huge loop in performance just within the next line of cards and having the OC addition of an already upgraded card. Though, Nvidia made their lineup rather confusing and a bit frustrating for some this time around, especially for those who have already chosen the vanilla 1650 which happens to be the same price at the moment, I appreciate their effort into making a card (from all manufacturers) that despite it's inferior specs to some of the competition, can still outperform some of those cards, whether all the time or at some point in a game, depending on the model of course, and without the need to upgrade to more power, sizable form-factors, and even specs, which shows that even that doesn't tell the whole deal on performance. The only real downside about this I can say is it seems a little fragile with what looks to be thinner PCB, shroud, and backplate, and it runs very hot, especially boosted. What I do like about the card is Asus's effort into thinking about other factors in design like dust-resistance and fan bearings. I've had 3 cards fail because the bearings would wear out within a year or two and start grinding without even many hours into the games, or at least many being the \"typical\" gamer average, I'm talking failure within about 5 hours of playing a demanding game after just doing minor graphical tasks on every other instance for the span of 1-2 years. After the card nears 80, it does downclock at some point so that it could get back into the mid-70s without a huge performance loss but temperature is certainly its weak point; the heatsink and overall heat dissipation setup is rather small as well, so that doesn't help. After having 3 cards fail, longevity has been my main concern; these little cards just seem to give out rather early. I'm hoping the new bearings, IP5X dust-resistance, and technology behind the card will help its lifespan, and that the heat won't become an issue for the card itself, performance, and rest of my components. With a 1850+Mhz clock boost, at its size, it's power requirements, and it's performance, this thing is a beast in a compact package, not just with what it can do but the thought behind the specs and technology of the card and its components as well. It's nice to see a company for once make a positive change, and not release the same exact design for a basic card despite the lineup difference. Hopefully other companies can take note and start using something like ball bearings for their fans and take into account little issues vulnerable components can face and put more thought into their cards, however, with this Asus, temperature is the only real concerning problem that I would say maybe they haven't put much thought into as far as that regard, maybe all out performance was their focus, or maybe didn't think it would be an issue? Either way, this is a nice card, I chose this version over the Zotac mainly because of the bearings and tech behind it, also it was only $5 more and is factory OC'd. After 3 bad Zotac experiences, I think my choice was justified.\n\nPros:\n\n*Excellent performance for its class and size.\n\n*Fairly compact single fan design with minor fitting issues I ran into with the backplate needing to budge/be pulled hard and held toward the screw holes to put the screws in.\n\n*Extra thought into the design of some of the most important components\n\n*Does look nice imo with the \"ASUS Geforce GTX\" font on the side while viewing inside the case.\n\nCons:\n\n*Runs hot with small heat dissipation setup and not much that can be done to resolve the issue\n\n*Could have looked a little nicer in terms of aesthetics but with something like this already, that's just nitpicking, though I'm sure it could have been done.\n\n*Packaging might have been missing stuff, or ditched GPU Tweak II CD but it might have been done intentionally on this model. Box is rather barebones once you lift the cardboard holding the card, so I feel it could have been downsized to save on materials.\n\nMix:\n\n*build quality seems just average, or less than what I'd like it to be, just a standard card made to do one job, but feels a little fragile with what seems to be thinner parts and some low-quality feeling materials. Hard to tell its durability and strength. The PCB and backplate seem a little thinner than usual or what I'm used to, and the plastic shroud just feels lightweight/cheap and/or thin of itself, not sure about the actual quality of all the components though. Could just be using not necessarily lower-grade but different materials. Who knows? Could end up being better, at least I hope.\n\nUPDATE: 3/23/21. ASUS, please keep using ball-bearing fans and I'll buy your cards every single time, since no other company seems to think about fan design and longevity, my last 3-4 cards died between 1 and 3 years from fan-failure because the sleeve bearings would go bad and start grinding from drastic temperature changes after playing some demanding games."}, {"title": "Perked up my old Lenovo", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2020", "text": "I purchased this to replace the factory installed GT730 on my Lenovo Ideacentre 710-25ISH I bought from Best Buy six or so years ago. I tried streaming Train Simulator 2020 on Twitch and a friend commented that the capture was laggy. I had noticed that my PC would take a hit on frames in high traffic areas, and could only play on medium detail settings at best. I purchased an EVGA 750 G5 Gold-Series modular power supply at the same time as the 1650 to ensure I had more than enough juice for the new GPU before installation. The GPU was larger than I expected but still left plenty of room in the case. I liked the black with white racing stripes design but as I don't have a clear case it will (hopefully) be a long time before I see it again. The GPU plugged right into the PCI slot and snugged right in to the backing plate once it was secured. This GPU did require me to remove a second backing plate in order for it to fit properly, my old 730 only took up the one. This GPU also requires a 4-pin plug connection from the PSU to power it; it will not receive power solely from the PCI slot. I haven't had enough time in Train Simulator to take actual FPS readings, but can tell you the game now runs at its highest detail settings like butter. Zero lag, very smooth, and the added detail is like night and day. This is a great GPU that offers a budget upgrade without hogging up all the space in a tower and demanding a ton of power."}, {"title": "So far, the best value entry level gaming PLUS streaming.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2020", "text": "I bought this thinking I might be able to stream 1080p 60fps but BEWARE there will be a LOT of stutters, duplicated frames during the stream/recording. I do either 900p or 720p for smooth streaming and gaming. Make sure to run OBS as administrator. If you're looking to play and stream at the same time and you don't have a lot of money to spend, this card is a go.\n\nHere are my thoughts. I'm pretty sure you've watched reviews on Youtube but here goes anyways. If you haven't, though, you should.\nNoise: The fans only ramp up during streaming and gaming where the GPU has to work extra hard, otherwise, barely audible if you have a completely quiet room. If you have either speakers or normal headphones, you won't be able to hear the noise at all.\n\nPerformance: You really get what you pay for. You can play triple A games at low or medium settings at 1080p 60fps EASILY. This card doesn't even sweat. As long as you don't ask for too much, you'll be satisfied for sure.\n\nThermals: Averages around 70-75 degree Celsius under full load. Peaks at 75 degrees when you play demanding games for hours, it doesn't go above that at all if you don't overclock it. It's already factory overclocked and still has some room for overclocking.\n\nOverall, this card is one of the best, if not THE best entry level graphics card, and you add streaming to that value. You can't really go wrong with this card. It won't disappoint you. You might think it's bad because of the bad reputation that the normal 1650 has, but this card is on another level. For $20 more bucks, you get 40% more performance than the normal GTX 1650, the new NVENC encoding with Turing architecture for streaming, and in this card's case, overclocked, quiet and excellent cooling."}, {"title": "Pretty loud fans, but great budget performance.", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2020", "text": "Please keep in mind I purchased this card at $180. I would recommend against paying for the Winter 2020 price of this card, as the performance is definitely not worth the current price.\n\nI may have got an excellent copy, but this card can sit at 2GHz overclock pretty happily. Many games can run at 1080 60fps at high or ultra, but you do tend to see the limitations of 4GB VRAM. For workstation usage, having the new NVENC encoder is great for working in Premiere, but again more VRAM would be nice. I don't run many AAA titles but expect to run them around medium-high, which for me is definitely acceptable.\n\nIn terms of the actual TUF 1650S, while I did look for a dual fan for better noise, this card is still pretty loud. It gets annoying when you need to restart your computer often. I believe it isn't the actual air moving, but the fans themselves, as running older cards with different fan designs are much quieter.

This card benchmarks similar or better performance than a nVidia 2070 Super, at a much lower price! That's always been AMD's A game, best bang for the buck, and they've hit that spot again.\n\nNow specifically about this card. I was leary about spending less on a card when the \"bigger name\" brands are $30-$100 more, but I've had XFX cards in the past and they've worked just fine, so I gave this one a shot.\n\nOut of the box, this card was MUCH larger than I expected. I had to move around SATA ports just to get it to fit. I expected it to be around the size of my RX480, but I way underestimated that! So know going in you need to make sure your motherboard layout isn't going to be effected by this card's size. It's much wider and longer than any previous AMD card I've seen.\n\nNow, as for the performance. On boot, everything seemed great. I've always had problems with AMD's drivers, they're notorious for having buggy, crashing driver releases. I've always had multiple system crashes when doing clean installs of AMD's graphics drivers in the past. But doing a complete clean driver install worked flawlessly, no crashes on the driver install. Huge pleasant surprise!\n\nThen I tried playing some games to start testing the performance. That's where I started to run into serious problems. Every game I tried to play, my computer would hard lock. The GPU driver was crashing. Obviously that's incredibly frustrating for a brand new high end graphics card. I tried changing game settings, both in regular gaming and VR, and nothing changed. Drivers would crash every time after getting into the game (though the menus would load fine).\nBefore considering an RMA, I looked into the issue to see how many others were having these problems, and it appears to be a very large number of people. After a couple of hours of digging, I discovered the issue was because the graphics card is overlooked out of the box WAY over stock, and even higher than the highest advertised overclocked cards. This is why it was crashing. This is a serious oversight from a firmware/driver standpoint. The default settings should never be overclocked. The main problem comes from the voltage is set at 1.2mV by default, and the card can't handle that much voltage. You have to undervolt the card, in my case to 0.99mV in order to get the card to run on stock settings.\nThat in itself is a simple enough fix, except that you can't force the card to actually run at those settings by default, you have to use software to change those settings on system startup. And that's where another issue came up. AMD's software for overclocking (or in this case underclocking) their hardware, Wattman, would not save these new settings on startup no matter what I tried. Every boot, even with the software running on startup and the profile saved as default, the card would start with the original default settings. This would be incredibly frustrating to have to manually change the graphics settings on every reboot/crash.\nSo rather than use AMD's software, I had to resort to using other software to manage the settings. In this case MSI AfterBurner. MSI's software has worked flawlessly for years, but it does have issues with compatibility with VR (specifically Oculus), so do keep that in mind if you do a lot of VR gaming.\nThe next issue that I ran into is that apparently AMD's FreeSync does NOT work with this card, at least on the current drivers. So that also had to be disabled, which is incredibly disappointing, but would certainly have to be fixed at some point. So I'm waiting for further driver updates to hopefully be able to turn that back on.\n\nAfter finally getting all of that sorted out, it was finally time to test some games! This thing is an absolute beast for gaming. A massive upgrade from my RX480! I play in 2k resolution, and the RX480 (even if overclocked) would struggle to keep even 30 FPS in some demanding games on high/ultra settings, but not this! I can max out all graphics settings and play at 2k resolution and keep over 60 FPS on every game I've tried! The only notable exception being Star Citizen, but being an Alpha it's terribly poorly optimized, and even the highest end systems struggle to keep 60 FPS everywhere. But I do keep a stable 45 FPS average, which is fantastic. Though most games are able to sustain 144 FPS as well, for an incredible gaming experience! Specially Elite Dangerous stays at 144 FPS even in large battles!\n\nI want to knock more stars off this card just for all the frustration I went through just to get it to even work, but since then I haven't had a single issue with the card. It runs perfectly now! So just go into getting this card (and I would assume other 5700XT boards may have this same issue) knowing that you're going to have to do some tweaks before you'll be able to use it. AMD has the absolute worst driver support, it's downright dreadful. But they've always been this way. If their software team could actually catch up to their hardware team, they'd probably be killing nVidia on all fronts. They just can't.\n\nSo overall, I definitely recommend this card for an upgrade. It was a huge upgrade for me and it's nice to have great gaming performance again. Just know you're going to likely have issues until they sort all of this out!"}, {"title": "2022 AMD Updated Drivers and Fixed Black Screen Issues Card is Amazing", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2022", "text": "This card at launch when I purchased it was plagued with the same video card driver issues AMD has become notorious for in the community.

Keep in mind that all of these improvements whilst still drawing the same power and without overclocking. That's right, stock speed baby.

Can be tempered.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2020", "text": "I think this is really worth 4.5 stars, but I don't want to short-change it.\n\nThis card is pretty great given that it's usually the more budget-conscious of 5700XT. Which is not to say \"it works fine BUT...\" We've skipped some RGB but have a metal backplate and metal accents on a very solid-feeling shroud. Personally I don't care what the shroud feels like - I'm not going to really hold the thing. Make it look nice and call it a day. But the metal brackets and plates don't seem to hurt anything. An aggressive-looking shroud too, but not to a degree that it becomes cringey.\n\nIt's easy to lose reference on size in GPU cards especially when looking at dual-fan designs, and this one is quite large. It has a two-slot interface on the output-end of the card but it has a substantial radiator and does take up three slots worth of space over the motherboard. I had to give up wifi for this. mATX builders take not that you will only really be left with one slot available and miniITX that you may not fit into a tight case.\n\nThe temperatures and fan noise out of the box are the biggest concern here. AMD temperature reporting maybe looks worse than it is, but that isn't to say this card is fairly hot and loud as received due the the factory overclock/overvolt and aggressive fan curves. There is a bios switch to enable a more basic bios with less aggressive fan curves, but while it's easy, it's not going to be the best method of dealing with these issues. Better to use AMD's own Wattman from the Radeon drivers that you'll install anyways and use that to undervolt and tune some clock speeds. There's a very good chance that this will drop your temps enough and keep your fans from running so high. You could further tweak the fan curves to tune the speeds. I know this seems like a lot of overhead and it could encourage you to look elsewhere, but honestly it's not bad and something you should do for any 5700XT. So it's worth doing regardless.\n\nMake sure you have a good power supply, though. Recommended is a 600 W but you'll need both an 8-pin and a 6-pin power. There are adapters included and I won't say they won't work, but conventional wisdom is that you really should use those as a permanent solution. Can't say I've ever heard of it really causing a problem, though.\n\nOverall, I'm happy to have this as it has everything I need and it's very light on the gimmicks. I've got Destiny 2 running at 1440p and highest settings (except lighter AA and no motion blur) around 130-150 fps. A smallish but significant upgrade from my GTX 1080.

I'd recommend avoiding the card.\n\nI purchased a Nitro+ RX 570 8GB from Platinum Micro Inc on 8/29/18 and received the card 9/6/18. My wife and i were about to move so i didn't test the card until 10/4/18 when i found that there was an issue with the card. I tried to trouble shoot the problem myself through the 10/6/18 when i found some postings (see toms hardware, amd support, ect...) , that this was a known issue with the Sapphire cards and likely a bios problem. 17 and 18 series drivers i tried gave me an error reading \"No AMD graphics driver is installed, or the AMD driver is not functioning properly. Please install the AMD driver appropriate for your AMD hardware\" on BIOS 1 and i get frames about the same as my 5 year old 7870 on bios 2. Newer drivers read bios 2 as an RX 580 in GPU-Z and same issue with frame rates. The only way that BIOS 2 functions is with drivers that are almost a year old (17 series drivers) and makes me doubt support for current gen titles coming out this year. I filed for a return on 10/7/18 and was denied as i filed 1 day outside of the window. I first called amazon and asked about their 90 day A-Z guarantee and was told that because the seller was a 3rd party seller the 90 day guarantee didn't apply. I ran through Sapphire support for a few days before they recommended an RMA with their 3rd part RMA company, Althon Micro. Althon Micro has given me an rma number and on their email requested the use of bubble wrap and packing peanuts which with shipping ran about $40. I'm worried though that their fix for the problem is a bios re-flash which would void any factory warranty i have on this card. After this fiasco I'm avoiding sapphire cards.

This GPU has done the job of letting me go anywhere on the internet without video lag.\n\nI had a more expensive NVIDIA GPU in my system with otherwise state of the art hardware. The newest most power Ryzen 9 \\ 5900 CPU, fast memory and a 750 watt power supply. The NVIDIA GPU ran like hot garbage on my Ubuntu system. Ubuntu has a nasty sepia color scheme that saturates the entire OS and everything in it. It is not only ugly but painful to look at due to my vision issues.\n\nI did not know for sure at the time but, I hoped a new video card from someone other than NVIDIA might perform better. Turns out this AMD designed GPU got rid of the nasty sepia tint. This video card creates a simple un-tinted OS that is a pleasure to use. The card is not BIG and uses only the power supplied by the GPU slot.\n\nThe card has some energy saver garbage installed that turns the card off if you power down your monitor. I took a star off for the energy saver mess. There really are no other issues.

that seem to be on peoples mind when contemplating purchasing this exact model rx 5700xt by power color(axrx 5700xt 8gbd6-3dh)\n\nok first this is not a big card, I knew it was going to be on the small side but i did not expect it to be no bigger than the older model rx 570s from the likes of gigabyte or xfx and actually when i hold them up side by side this card is actually smaller than my Nvidia rtx 2060 super founders card and that was a surprisingly small card, so this is a perfect size for the case i have included in the photos thats the case i have put this card into\n--given this cards petite build and very light weight i had ZERO expectations for good thermal management...but continue reading and i think i will effectively covey just how wrong i was about that but keep in mind that this case has the gpu literally right on the side with a massive intake basically spanning the entire side of the case were the pcie slot is so that is undoubtedly influencing my thermals and fan noise\nok on to performance. first lets identify my hardware here with a list of my parts that are in this build so we can get a better idea of how well this runs as a complete product because how useless are gpu performance and thermal numbers without knowing full system specs and how the performance and thermals of a graphics card influences total system performance\n*case - silverstone sugo sg13b mesh\n*cpu - intel i7 8700k\n*cpu cooler - corsair h60(2018) 120mm closed loop liquid cooler\n*motherboard - msi z370i pro carbon mini itx\n*ram - corsair vengance pro ddr4 16gb(2x8gb) at 3600mhz at cas16\n*ssd - samsung 950 pro(first gen) m.2 nVME 512gb ssd for windows 10\n*ssd - silicon power a40 256gb sata 2.5in ssd for a cut down debian linux install for phoronix test suite(for testing)\n*hdd - Western Digital white label 8TB red drive that runs at 5900rpm pulled from a WD external drive\n*psu - Thermaltake white label 700watt 80+ white certified( this was a concern at first as i was not confedent this was going to be able to power all my hardware reliably and altho i have long term usage concerns now after i replaced the 120mm fan with a pwm fan and ran the pwm signal wire to the motherboard for advanced thermal control i am not worried at the moment but i will look into picking up a at least bronze certified of the same specs but also keep in mind that with this form factor the only system fans i have are the intake 120mm for the AIO cooler and the 120mm on the power supply so i needed to mod this in order to have more granular control of both fans and i must say im super stoked that i did because all that in this case makes for a perfect air duct from the front over the board and out the back via the psu now adding a relatively hot GPU into the mix was the last thing i wanted but looking at the total system performance im shur glad i did because of the way this case is built this gpu easily pulls in its own fresh air from the side and throws ip up towards the vents on top so even if this gpu hits 90c on the junction it end up having very little effect on full system temps\nok giving all those specs i was not expecting super high performance even tho there is no reason a i7 8700k cant still handle high fps gaming at a modest 2560x1440 at around 120 to 144fps and to my suprise it did just fine\nok on to the thermals wich is arguably the most concerning for people when considering this card and unless i completely won the silicon lottery it duz not need to concern anybody i fan a full 6 hour stress test in furmark and shur my junction temps came close to 90c but never hit that but the core stayed under 80c the hole time and the memory temps stayed under 60c the whole time, ran ran this stress test in conjunction with a small fft stress on my cpu so i could get a total system thermal worse case and that were these temps came from when i just ran the furmark stress test i didn't come anywhere near this high of temps on the card and all together i dont think i ever got higher than 30c above ambient here in Nebraska were its getting a little chili out lol\nok so here are my final thoughts on this, if you are looking for a amd gpu that is very high performance and you dont want to wait for maybe ever for rdna 2 and you need something that is going to fit into a small case with good airflow this is the card for you also it has the added bonus of being slightly obscure so the prices are usly the lowest for a new rx 5700xt at least at the time of righting this, now that being sead if you can afford the price and physical real estate of going with a bigger card with possibly 3fans you will simply have much better performance numbers and even possibly be able to overclock a little bit (by that i mean allow watt man to overclock for you as its basically fully automated at this point im super excited about that little development as i also have the giant xfx rx 5700xt thik 3 model that is setup with dual bios so i can take one and just go to town on the overclock and push close to 220watts, but thats for a different review that i will also be making here on that once my absolute army of tests is done\nok now to address so other concerns i was reading on other reviews...right now as of today the 15th of October 2020 i am running the latest optional drivers from amd and i am seeing ZERO instability and the thermals and total power consumption are well within spec( at he hottest my card was pulling 180watts) and that is with the stock performance setting on wattman no over volt or overclock or the opposite i didn't under clock anything either i specifically wanted to find out what the OUT OF BOX experience was going to be like so i could put some information out there for others to help them make a decision on this seemingly to good to be true obscure graphics card from power color and i believe i have done that...\\\nmy conclusion is if PCPARTSPICKER list is saying this is the best card that will fit in your build than buy it if there are clear options for bigger cards like the red devil or the asus strix than buy one of those instead or even the xfx thic 3 but i have heard of thermal issues with the thic 2 but in reality if your running a normal size none sff case the 3 fan thic 3 is going to fit its no bigger than any other 3 slot card(actually uses only 2 pcie slots but the card itsslef is super thick and takes up 3 internally) ok but thats not the point here were discussing the axrx 5700xt 8gbd6-3dh\nand on that in my experience everybody can set aside there performance concerns and thermal concerns as long as you have good airflow to it this card will run fine\nps after running all the stess tests i dont think my cards fans were ever hitting above 60% or if they were they were just rely quiet and at idle they are off so all in all its not a load card and keep in mind in my case the gpu intake is literally less than an inch from the side vents so i rely was expecting this to be a bit louder and just to clarify i run this system backwards with the io facing me so the gpu was also facing me and still total syste noise was negligible and actually quieter than when i had the rtx 2060 super fe in here as its idle fan speed was like 40% and ramped up to 90 within 5mins of a stress test now am i disparaging nvidia here for there FE coolers NO i love that card but i put that into an even more space constrained aluminum box from aliexpress its very nice and it is a matx sff build nut that was literally the only high performance modern gpu that would fit as it has the power cables on the side and not the top were there is literly no room in between the side aluminum panel and the top of the gpu so i had to sacrifice my more expensive 2060s on that build and that is why i was looking for a replacement for this one as its an older intel platform and not my primary rig but i jumped into this fully expecting to haf to down clock this to basically a 5700 not xt specs or even a 5600 and for the price i was totaly ok with that and was actually one of the deciding factors in picking this model as it uses the reference pcb the from stock rx 5700xt so future water cooling a gpu inside this RIDICULOUSLY small case was just kind of exciting lol and still not off the table now that i find out this card runs just fine at fully stock and is very competitive with my bigger RTX 2070super FE thats what was rely surprising as i paid 499 for that and no were near that for this and ironically this card will perform way better in linux as it is native MESA vesa and will not need to leverage nvidia to volcan runtime conversions and im no levelonetechs but i know my way around linux and rely enjoy tinkering with it and this will enable some pretty good performance numbers for paired with this easly clocked to 5ghz water cooled 8700k so ya im not regretting this purchase one bit...\nbut dont misunderstand me if i find any problems with this card long term i will definitely update this review and then you as a buyer can decide if those issues are a deal breaker in the future but likely there will already be a slurry of other options out there especially once RDNA2 comes to the DIY space but for now and for a while RDNA1 is what we have available as amd is still leveraging market share from the next gen consoles which are using RDNA2 so they will likely try to enjoy the win there for a while befor putting that tech on the DIYPC market and reaffirming the PC as the performance king over any console that way they get 2 wins and quite frankly after the whole FX dry spel and the rx vega flop they kinda need the wins...\n\n...update...ok so 3 months and one debacle of a election later this card is still working perfectly and is even more stable today still using the optional rolling release drivers as opposed to the slightly older LTS drivers so ya no problembs at all...one slight complaint and it's not even a real one but a superficial one with the light weight feel of the whole card, is it is a small card and since it realy dosnt produce the kinda heat a overclocked card running at over 200watts it dosnt need anything more than a cheap light aluminum cooler stack but it still feels cheap lol ...this dosnt effect performance at all at least in this specific card as it simply dosnt need a more dence cooling solution so no real complaints just that one very first world one lol"}, {"title": "Mostly Reliable", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2020", "text": "I

It's giving me the framerates I need to play at high/max settings at 1440p, and a definite performance improvement over the GTX 980Ti I was using previously.\n\nI bought this card as an upgrade from an aging nVidia GTX 980Ti. I have a ASUS ROG Strix X470-I Gaming ITX motherboard, 32GB of DDR3200 CL16 RAM, a AMD Ryzen R7 2700X, and a 1440p FreeSync display (LG 32GK650F).\n\nI needed a card that would fit in my Fractal Design Node 304 case, and many other 5700XT cards were too long to fit into the case and would block back of the power supply. This card is taller than most cards, but it's not as long as the other 5700XTs on the market, so it's able to fit into the Node case better. The Node case has a built-in mesh cutout on the side of the cover next to the GPU slot and that lets the dual fans on this card get cool air.\n\nSince I started using this 5700XT card, I had issues with the graphics driver crashing during long gaming sessions. AMD doesn't have the best reputation for their drivers so I thought it would eventually get fixed in a driver update. But as the weeks passed by and new drivers came out, it continued to randomly crash and I was regretting switching over to an AMD card. I starting to think about returning or selling this card.\n\nI didn't think I'd be the only one with this issue, so I searched some forum posts on Reddit and the usual tech websites. I saw that AMD recommends a 700W power supply for these cards, 600W minimum ( https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/radeon-rx-5700-series-quick-start-guide-en.pdf ). My power supply is a 550W Seasonic Focus Gold+, which is just below AMD's minimum guidance. This suggested to me that the 12V pci-e cable was sagging in voltage and that maybe was what was contributing to making the card crash. On my previous card, the 980Ti, I just ran a single cable that had daisy chained 6 + 2 pci-e connectors and that supplied power to the two pci-e power connectors (one is 8 pin, the other is a 6 pin). The single cable was good enough for my old 980Ti, I thought would work with this new card.\n\nI managed to dig up a second pci-e 8 pin power cable and I attached it in parallel with the other pci-e cable going to this 5700XT card. After I gave each pci-e power connector its own cable, the card has been rock solid despite being on a slightly undersized power supply. The extra cable is now allowing the card to get the power/voltage it needs. It's Ohm's law: as the amperage goes up, the voltage goes down. The load is now split across more wires and there's naturally less resistance and less of a voltage drop. I'll have to remember this for future builds."}, {"title": "Very Good Performance, but I'm concern for the temperatures", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2020", "text": ""}, {"title": "SO FAR, it's excellent", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2019", "text": "I like the design of this card, and comparative reviews show that it has good cooling on the GPU and Memory.

I use this card for about 8 or 9 hours a day, and i use it for gaming and game development in unity. The card works as expected and has no issues running games such as fortnite at 120 fps high settings. you can run ultra as well but you're going to want to cap the frames to 60 fps as to reduce frame drops. Unity runs very well, and is far better at building scenes and generating lighting(which was the biggest problem i had with my 750 ti).\n\npros -\n6 gigabytes of vram.\n\n2 DVI ports to support dual monitors(i tested to ensure this works on windows 10, it does)\n\nDual fans for better cooling. if you buy a 1060 i really recommend buying one with dual fans. it'll last much longer if cooled more adequately. i was worried mine would have cooling problems as i have a small case in a room thats usually about 74 to 75 degrees fahrenheit. but interestingly it only reached 107 fahrenheit under load. which for a gpu is not bad.\n\ncons - none really ;)\n\npretty standard situation here. its a great card of course but it wont function as well as cards higher in the price range, which is to be expected.\nbut for 300 USD this will do everything. i have not tested this against its amd counter part the rx 580/480 or with VR.

The 1050 is a great card but the performance difference is huge while the price difference was moderate. The 1070 is an excellent card but it would end up costing more than my entire computer. Most of the Nvdia 1060 GPUs are roughly the same regardless of the maker. The main difference is the fans/cooling, the appearance, and the ports. This gigabyte offers dual fans that supposedly offer more cooling due to the fan design. I am not sure if its true but the temps have been fairly consistent and the fan is very quiet. Keep in mind that with minimal to moderate use the fans do not come on at all (unlike GPUs of the past) once you reach a certain degree of use the fans will ramp up as needed. Also worth noting is that this generation of Nvida cards have \"auto overclocking\" which means they can adjust their frequency depending on how you are using it. This has worked out very well so far with the card humming with light apps at less than 400mhz and then going to full clock with heavy games. The temperatures are reasonable (about 66 degrees at full load) and the performance has been spotless with my Core i5 setup.\n\nThe only real downside to this is that it comes with no accessories.

It gives you the ability to monitor the card memory, temp, speed as well as the GPU and even your CPU Temps.\nCompared to the GTX 950 2GB card it replaced it runs every game I have at max settings, with ease (the 950 could not run some of my games at max settings without some tearing and lagging). I love it so far and would recommend it to any gamer up to an intermediate level (maybe beyond - depending on the games). It does take two card slots and uses the 6 pin external power connecter on the end of the card. It fit well in my ATX case, does not crowd the HDs or SDDs installed.

Most games at this resolution at high/ultra will fall between 2-3 GB RAM usage, so this will cover most. For now. 6 GB RAM is a little more future proof, while also being way overkill for current games at 1080p. So, totally a personal choice if the extra cost is worth it. The RAM isn't the only difference between the 3 and 6 GB versions, but third party benchmarking reviews would suggest it's the primary noticeable difference.\n\nIn terms of performance if you're upgrading an older 960 to this 1060, how noticeable the upgrade will be depends on the game obviously. For a game like World of Warcraft, you'll see little difference. For a game like Tom Clancy's Wildlands, the difference is noticeable. You had to really dial back settings to get RAM usage down under 2 GB, but are able to jack a lot of settings back up with the 1060 which helps to separate it from its console versions.\n\nIt supports Nvidia Ansel, but that's been hit or miss for me. Doing ultra high resolution screenshots will often crash the supported game (ie: Mass Effect: Andromeda at the highest res Ansel supports will manage to save the screenshot, but will also cause DX 12 crashes to the game). It's tough to say what's at fault there.\n\nAt the price I purchased it here ($180), it was pretty much a no brainer generational update to my old 960 (~$20 less than what I paid for my 960 2 GB when the 960 came out)."}, {"title": "Fast card, nice cooler, But 8Gbps not 9Gbps.", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2017", "text": "Ordinarily this would be one of the most expensive GTX 1060 GPUs on the market, but the GPU market is sort of erratic due to the increase of cryptocurrency mining.

At full load with Furmark, my card maxes out at 69 degrees Celsius. My PC case has five 120mm fans in use to keep air flowing, but it is also closed off inside of a compartment of my desk that constricts airflow.\n\nSo far, this GPU has run every game at 1080p with max settings easily. In Fallout 4, I maxed all settings and the GPU hit 80% usage at its highest. I also tried Tomb Raider (2012), Fable III, and Shogun II: Total War. All ran perfectly with maxed settings.\n\nIt should be noted there is an error on the product description. The GPU's 6GB of RAM operates at 8Gbps, not 9Gbps. There are two versions of this card that are essentially the same. This model is Rev. 2, and it is has 8Gbps memory from Micron. The Rev. 1 model is the one with 9Gbps memory. The performance difference isn't huge between the two, but make sure you know which one you are buying. I kicked one star off for that, because I thought I was getting the 9Gbps model. I'm pleased enough with the card not to want to return it though.\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that this GPU comes with no accessories at all. You get a GPU, a single sheet of paper with instructions on how to put the GPU in your PC, and a driver CD. You don't get any cables, PCI-E adapters or cable adapters. This is somewhat unusual.

However, on the first try plugging in my new RTX 3060 Ti GPU into the riser, I had to use the motherboard graphics port to view what was happening after POST.

Plugged the GPU directly to motherboard without the riser installed and everything showed up fine, so I continued installing drivers like normal. With drivers installed, I decided to go back and see if the riser would work. No such luck. BIOS and Device Manager still won't recognize that a GPU is install. So now I suspect this is a PCIe v4.0 compatibility problem as this riser cable is a PCIe v3.0. My motherboard is a ASUS Intel ROG MAXIMUS XI HERO that is also PCIe v3.0, so in theory, this riser should have worked, especially when GPU work fine directly plugged into the mother board as the GPU is both PCIe v3.0 and v4.0 compatible. I've professionally worked electronics and IT for over 35 years and I inspected the connector contacts and everything looks perfect.

It ran any game a threw at it in 1680 x 1050 4x AA 8x AF while maintaining about 100fps and higher (can do about 400-500 in CS:S). This card is huge, and a bit heavy for a video card. I do like the cover on the card because I can just grab the card with my hand, and not worry about breaking or bending anything. It uses 2x 6-pin PCI-E cords, and they are located on the side facing the left side of the case. This allows them to be out of the way of the hard drive cage if that were to be an issue. I believe it is about 5-10mm longer than your standard ATX motherboard. So if you need to measure, just see if you have an 1\" to 1-1/2\" of space between your motherboard and hard drives, and you will be fine.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks though, my 260 started having issues.\n\nNo matter what game, or how low the settings were, the card would shoot up to 90C and higher. Eventually it would hit the thermal threshold and restart the computer. I have a CM690 case, which has enough ventilation, but I even bought more fans. The card kept overheating for no reason, even when I had the fan run 100% at all times. The funny thing is, if it was 50-60C at idle, I would open up one of the Vista games, and it would jump back down to high 40C. Now this shouldn't happen when my Core 2 Duo E8400 was only running 40C under load.\n\nI did some research around the internet, and saw a lot of forums where at least one person(per forum) was having a similar issue. I even opened up a thread on the EVGA forums to debunk the issue. They pointed to bad ventilation, but I got more powerful front and side fans and two 140mm fans for my case, to go on the top and bottom. I even re-arranged the power cords (modular PSU) to allow for more ventilation, all of that only delayed the overheating. Then the EVGA users pointed to the power supply, and asked me to check the rails. All of the voltages were above average (tested on an industrial Fluke meter). I even traded out the motherboard (EVGA 730i -> EVGA 790i Ultra) because the northbridge was heating up a lot too. Still the video card overheated.\n\nI eventually ended up stepping up to a 275 GTX (which was faster and $20 less than this card at the time). Since then no video card overheating problems, and my 275 has been through hotter weather than my 260 had been in.\n\nThis card is a fast card, but most people were/are getting \"lemons\" like I did. If you get this card and don't have overheating issues, then you have a good deal. If you do not feel like going through what I went through, go ahead and get a base GTX 275. The 275 runs just as fast, if not faster, and runs cooler than this 260. EVGA of course is the best tech support in the business, so any video card you get should be an EVGA. I have never been disappointed with their tech support, and I have owned a 5200FX, 6600, 6800, 260, and 275 (all EVGA) and have always been happy after getting off the phone with them when I have a problem."}, {"title": "Works well with a 3-year old PC", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2009", "text": "I bought this card to upgrade my existing PC (see specs below). That PC is almost 3 years old and with a new card, power supply, and more memory, I hope to get another 3 years out of it, before looking for a replacement. The cost of the card (and power supply, and more memory) is expected to be about one-third of the price of a current day equivalent replacement PC\n\nInstallation\nPhysical installation was pretty straightforward , and took 5-10 minutes. As other reviewer have noted, the card is long indeed (a little over 10 inches), but it fit in the case with room to spare. One thing I noticed was that in my pc, the card covered 2 PCI slots (one PCI express, one non-PCI express), while using only one (the PCI Express). Results may vary in your situation.\nSoftware installation was a little more cumbersome, but it may have been caused that Windows Auto Update tried to install software during the installation of the driver software. I ended up crashing the computer and had to install the drivers a total of 3 times. Again, not sure if this had to do with the drivers themselves.\n\nThe software is pretty straightforward, and it comes with trial version of a handy tool (\"FRAPS\"). This tool allows you to measure framerates among other things. It appears that you can record screen shots and movies of your games as well, but I have not tried that functionality.\n\nOnce installed I tested it on 3 games:\nCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. This game allowed me to run with all possible options maxed out at 1900x1200, while achieving a framerate in the 60-70 range at graphic intensive points. (An example would be a scene at night in the rain, with lots of movement). At other time fps was well above 100\nAssassins Creed. Again I was able to run with all option maxed out at 1900x1200. The framerate hovered in the 35-40 range when churning through graphic intensive scenes; higher at other times. While not as high as hoped, I did not notice too much flickering\nCrysis SP Demo. I downloaded the demo when it first came out. It did run on the NVIDIA 7900 GS, but only at Medium settings in a 1200x768 resolution. Even then, the screen would sometimes flicker and stutter. With the new card, I could run it at high, in 1200*768 while achieving a fps of 30. I did not notice any noticeable flickering.\n\nNote: I did have to buy a new power supply, because the standard PSU that comes with the Dell is rated at 375W, which is not enough for this card. If you google a bit you can find a calculator that let's you estimate the total power need for your PC. It estimated my power need at 390W. I decided to go with a 550W PSU. It appears to be working well\n\nOverall, I think this card has given my computer an extension on life.

I play games on this card like the Battlefield series, Kingdoms of Amulur and Assassins Creed III and it handles them just fine.\n\nThe card itself is robust. I do video editing and due to the number of CUDA cores, it takes a 2.3hours movie it gets it done in about 20 minutes. Temperature is fine during the process. I can hit 64 degrees at a fan speed of 40%. Ran tests, got to 69 degrees at full load and fan kicked in to 68% so it cools very well. The cooling is great because it is actually channeled from inside the card straight to the back. Most cards today are open so all that heat goes in to your case, this card gets ALL that heat out the case.\n\nOne drawback to this card is that it can only due up to DirectX 10 so the newer games might not look as well, but time will tell.\n\nMust be a great card because I want another one to put them in SLI, but can never find the exact model. Which brings me to my next point. The temperatures may be affected because there are two of these, there is a 65nm one and then there is the 55nm one. The 55nm ones run really cool; no matter what you throw at it. The 65nm ones tend to get hotter so look for the 55nm.\n\nAll in all this is still a good card for a few more years. Well worth the price when I bought it.\nAlso be advised, this is not a small video card so be careful, I put this in an Antec 900 gaming case and I have to lose a drive bay.

Upon receipt of the card, I tested it under minimal load and found it did work. I had installed the card as card #2 in a dual-SLI setup (keep in mind, the #2 card will always run cooler than the #1 card). However, when running Fallout 3, the card began to blue-screen when the temp reached 45 deg. C.\nI removed the card and disassembled the cooler to give it a new application of Arctic MX4 thermal paste. During this procedure, I noticed the inside of the PCI bracket showed signs of some terrific heat: the metal was scorched and discolored.\nNone of the chips showed any signs of scorching, however, and after applying fresh MX3, the temps lowered a few degrees C, keeping it well below 45 deg. C, thus avoiding the blue-screening, at least while in the #2 position.\nI guess that for the price i paid, i should have expected the card to be less-than-perfect, but this card was definitely not well taken care of. In fact, it was abused. Thus, the description should have said it was in \"fair\" or \"working\" condition, but not \"Very Good\" as advertised, though one can't expect the seller to have tested the card as thoroughly as I did.\nAs long as i keep the temps down, it performs adequately, but i have to be careful to keep the operating conditions very, very cool.\nWhile the card's cooler was removed, i took the opportunity to replace the impeller fan with one from identical card whose cooler was replaced with an Arctic Accelero Extreme GTX cooler, one with practically no use, and it runs a bit quieter that the one that came with this card.\nUltimately, I will replace the stock cooler with an Accelero Extreme like my #1 card, and that will prevent the card from reaching 45 deg. C and the resulting blue-screening, but newer games like Crysis 2 will still drive the card to about 50 deg.

This is a 300 watt card but default setting limits it to drawing 250 watts and even rage mode limits it to drawing 280 watts- both of these result in performance that is below what it should be stock(not sure if this is a Sapphire issue or an AMD driver issue). Make sure you set your profile to manual and set the power tuning limit to max- this will allow the card to draw the full 300 watts and clock itself the way AMD intended under load.

This is a 300 watt card but default setting limits it to drawing 250 watts and even rage mode limits it to drawing 280 watts- both of these result in performance that is below what it should be stock(not sure if this is a Sapphire issue or an AMD driver issue). Make sure you set your profile to manual and set the power tuning limit to max- this will allow the card to draw the full 300 watts and clock itself the way AMD intended under load.

Without the proprietary driver, Linux defaults to a generic VGA-style driver that doesn't provide hardware optimizations.\n\nI was kind of pushed into this upgrade, since I wanted to move to the latest CentOS release. The new release requires a newer version of the AMD driver, and that new driver no longer supports the old Radeon HD 3450.

If you're getting it to with hopes of playing all your games at 60fps 1080p or something, well, you really shouldn't be looking at this card. Its a great card if you're not going into it with high-expectations.\n\nUpdate:\nThe card still works. However two months ago the pc started bluescreening. I though it was a graphics driver issue because the BSOD code or whatever kept pointing to ATI something or the other. Long story short, the thing was overheating and crashing. I'm not really sure why it decides to do this now, it was working fine up till this point streaming movies pretty much 24-7. Maybe the thermal paste needs to be replaced... but it feels like the heatsink is absorbing the heat well enough - it physically burns the skin to the touch, ouch!\n\nI 'fixed' this by mounting a small fan to the side of the case that blows air directly across it. It hasn't blue screen since. However the case the pc was originally in didn't have a place for a fan on the side panel so I did have to swap cases out too. I already had a spare case (go figure) so it didn't cost me anything. Still, if you plan to use this in a small little case with poor ventilation you may want to consider a card that has a little fan on it to help keep it cool.\n\nIf you're not using it in such a small hotbox of a case however you should be just fine. If not, smack a fan in there somewhere and that should take care of it.

The PC I use this in is set up to run either Win 7 or 8 (now 8.1). 8 crashed repeatedly, which I thought was 8's fault. I eventually realized the problem had to be related to the Nvidia card even though there were no problems with Win 7. I did some googling and found out the Nvidia's drivers are not fully compatible with Win 8 and can cause MAJOR crashes. We're not talking just BSOD's, we're talking SO much damage to the file system that the OS has to be reinstalled.\n\nSince I replaced the Nvidia card with this, Win 8.1 has been quite stable, so the problem was definitely the Nvidia drivers.\n\nOne thing I don't like about the card is the order of the three output connectors. To take the card in and out of a slot I have to remove the top screw \"post\". I don't know the technical term. The top connector is VGA, middle is HDMI and bottom is DVI. As is common for VGA connectors, when you plug in the connector there are two extended screws to hold the connector in place. Those screws fit into matching threaded \"posts\" above and below the VGA connector. On this one the top \"post\" is so near the top of the slot at the back of the PC that I have to remove the post to install or remove the board. If they had put the HDMI connector on top it wouldn't be a problem. (They may have put the VGA at the top so the card could fit in a low profile slot.)\n\nI don't do gaming or video editing, but the card is a great value and works for all the other things folks normally use a PC for. It runs well with either 32-bit Win 7 Home or Win 8.1 Pro.\n\nAlthough I basically haven't used AMD's Catalyst Control Center (which *is* installed), I do like the fact that it allows detailed control of all sorts of attributes, such as GPU scaling, color temperature control, etc."}, {"title": "It won't win any power contests, but it drives two monitors for cheap.", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2015", "text": "It's a pretty decent card for the price. I picked this up for my workplace computer. We recently got some new workstations that are form-factor Dell Optiplex machines that replaced our old mini-ATX tower computers. My old setup had integrated graphics that would run two monitors and I immediately missed that functionality with the new Dell. So, I went searching Amazon for the cheapest dual-output graphics card I could find. In short time I came across this XFX card. I've always had good luck with AMD/ATi in the past but this is my first experience with an XFX-branded card. I like that it came with two brackets to mount both outputs in low-pro mode. The screw hole that holds the HDMI output on the bracket didn't line up properly, but no biggie. It did not come with any mounting screws, I had to rob some from an old case (the new case didn't have any pre-installed). My only complaint is the ribbon cable holding the VGA output on is pretty short. My install situation forced me to put the VGA on top of the DVI and that stretched the ribbon to it's absolute limit. A little more slack would be nice for situations like mine. Otherwise it's a nice card - I'm not using for gaming, I just wanted two outputs on one card for as little money as possible.

Well this coupled with the PCI Express PCI-E 1X to 16X Slot Riser Card Flat Flexible Extension Cable (wire 19cm,total 24cm) , some minor case and wiring modifications, it worked perfectly. The XFX says that it required a power supply upgrade, but seems ok after 4 hours of gameplay. I had to splice into the +12v wires that go to the dvd burner, in addition to adding a +12v fan into the same splice to help cool the card. The software says that the card is running at 36 deg. C. The case modifications include splitting the card into two sections, with the included brackets: (A) the VGA output, the other (B) the DVI/HDMI output. (The entire thing together wouldn't fit into the PCI slots in the case, due to the clearance of the VC and riser plug into the bottom.) The section with the DVI/HDMI is too short, so I formed a straight piece of steel 1\" x 1/4\" that goes under the card, and pulls it forward toward the back of case. I then drilled/screwed this into place. If anyone ever tries this, you will see what I mean.

I replaced this for a 1050ti and holy crap did it feel alot more snappy. With the 1050ti i could run 144hz but with this one i can only run 60hz. I sold the 1050ti and switched back to this one in the meantime so i could still do my stuff on my pc but when i tried to play my games it ran horribly. Also, it makes my monitors colors look idk more gray, i have a Asus vg279q so it has good colors and 144hz but this gpu just takes that all away. I ran fortnite on performance mode and at 50% 3d resolution and it ran at barely 60fps. Then i tried Forza Horizon 4 and i got 15 fps MAX so yeah pretty bad. I overclocked it so now it runs 25 fps in FH4 so better but not great, and i can only put the 3d resolution up to 60% now with the overclock. After the overclock the screen started artifacting (black spots and lines on the screen) while gaming but it didnt bother me so i kept it like that. So to conclude, its not the best card for gaming and you'd be better off with integrated graphics, that being said if your pc doesnt have a IGPU i would get this card assuming its only for work and you just need to have a image on screen.

At completely stock settings the 1080, like all newer GTX cards, is designed to be silent THEN powerful. As a result, by design it ramps up to 83c and starts to dynamically throttle. It's nothing a custom fan profile can't fix, but the custom cooler cards [like Asus Strix 1080] are going to run cooler, clock higher [and use significantly more wattage.. I wanna say the strix listed 300w vs 180 stock] But let's be real: you're looking at a $600 card, power consumption is probably NOT the biggest priority on your list here.\n\nSo how does she GAME? Well, I can't speak to the latest AAA titles because I'm not a fan. HOWEVER: I *CAN* say that my average FPS on a dell 34\" 3440 x 1440 2k monitor [which they now call 4k for some reason] with a GTX 780 was approximately 160-180 with everything maxed on Diablo 3. with the GTX 1080 on my new 27\" 3840x2160 LG UD68-p 4k screen [which they now call UHD for some reason] I'm clocking 180-200 FPS with everything maxed. Given the increase in pixel density I'd call that a decent increase in frames.\n\nI could continue to talk frames, but let's face it: there are TONS of professional reviews out there that probably have your game du jour benchmarked at 1080, 2k, and 4k against any setup of cards. You're going to look at this review and go \"why even bother\"? \"You don't need that horesepower, what was the point\"?\n\nAnd to you I'd say: Occulus and Vive aren't going to be sold out forever. The 780ti would PROBABLY have worked, but I wanted guarantees, not wing-and-prayer hopes. 8 gig DDR5x takes Video ram completely out of the equasion for 4k resolutions [probably overkill still for a long time, but who knows, I can always grab another 34\" LG and run surround with 4k in the middle]\n\nUltimately I bought this card because I wanted it and I was at the right place at the right time to score one on launch day. To reiterate I WOULD NOT PAY MORE THAN $699 LIST FOR ANY FOUNDER'S EDITION OF THIS CARD! In a few weeks the scalpers should die out, and prices should return to normal, so just wait.\n\n\"But, you haven't told us if it's WORTH it\". Semi subjective, if you've already got a GTX 980ti or two I probably wouldn't bother just yet [wait for the 1080ti] but my system is quieter under load/gaming, significantly more FPS pushing more pixels. . . I'm happy with my purchase. Eventually I'll probably put an evga GPU cooler on it and start cranking things up [another thing to keep in mind, I've READ that the founders edition can be voltage limited, but if you're into heavy GPU overclocking you're probably already aware]\n\nUltimately your best option is to wait for the aftermarket cooled solutions, but if you're in need of a card like this and just \"happen\" to find one at the shelf of your local retail or e-tail store for the $699 MSRP. . .don't hesitate: She's still [probably] faster than you need"}, {"title": "WARNING DECEPTIVE ADVERTIZING", "rating": "1", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2021", "text": "The product is being advertised as a nvidia 1080 graphics card with pricing on par with a 1080. they are not selling a 1080, they state in the product info that it is actually a 1070 with the id numbers of a 1080. 1070s sell for half the listed price!"}]}, {"label": "MSI Gaming Radeon RX 5600 XT Boost Clock: 1620 MHz 192-bit 6GB GDDR6 DP/HDMI Dual Torx 3.0 Fans Freesync DirectX 12 Ready Graphics Card (RX 5600 XT GAMING MX)", "price": "624.00", "description": "Great gaming experiences are created by bending the rules.

Finally AMD released a new driver update mid March version 20.3.1 which seemed to fix the black screens and also addressed the known issues in the \"What's new\" portion of the driver update info.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is a 1080p killing machine!

Make sure it fits in your case before you buy it.\n2. Most RX 5600 XT's only need one 8-pin power connector, but this one needs two for some reason. Also, it needs the 7th and 8th pins to be connected, so plugging a 6-pin connector directly into it won't work even though it fits.

The listed clock speed is about 200mhz lower than the original cards which, at best, points to these being faulty cards flashed with a different BIOS to operate at a lower clock speed. HD 5770s and 6770s (same card with 2 names) also NEVER came with 4GB of VRAM.\n\nAgain, this points to this being a card with a fake BIOS. I've tested another faked GPU claiming to be a GTX 960 4GB and the card even reported itself as such to the computer. In actuality it was a GT640 with 1GB of VRAM. When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash.

In fact, the sealed PNY box included the video card and not so much as a single sheet of paper with quick install instructions or a driver disk or anything. It literally was a video card in a protective plastic clamshell within the box and there was absolutely nothing else in the box. It isn't worth me sending it back for them to simply send me another with no bracket so I have ordered a low profile bracket from a 3rd party for around $7 that will hopefully fit. This increases the price to $79 which is still around $5 less than the next least expensive gt 1030 that I could find. I definitely find the situation irritating that the description is incorrect.\n\nAs for the card itself, I removed the large bracket and went ahead and installed it in my preowned Dell Optiplex 790. It does fit in the small form factor with no issues and will be fully secured once I receive the proper low profile bracket.\n\nThe PC I installed this video card on has an old i5-2400 processor and 8gb of ddr3 1333 ram installed. I installed Windows 10 and Tomb Raider (2013) from my Steam library. Prior to installing the video card,\non low settings at 1080p, the Tomb Raider benchmark reported an average FPS of 6. That isn't a typo. The onboard graphics were terrible. After installing the PNY GT 1030 V5, on normal settings at 1080p the benchmark is a rock-solid 60fps. This isn't a powerful gaming card, but it is a fairly economic replacement for onboard graphics on older machines. My primary gaming pc has a gtx 1050ti which is a much better low end gaming option, but for an ultra low budget build it is a competent card for light gaming needs. I tested it for a couple of hours playing the Witcher 3 and it was able to handle the game without any hitching or stutters.\n\nWith this card you should be able to play most modern games and have a reasonably good experience, but you won't typically be able to use max settings and you may need to adjust some settings per game in the Nvidia control panel. Make sure you download the Geforce Experience application onto your PC and use it to download and install your driver, since the box doesn't include any software.\n\nFor $72 this little card is more capable than I was expecting and it definitely provides a good value for the price.

So in the overclock utility it is set to 100% but the second fan over the VRM won't kick on till its actually needed past a temperature of 60C even if you set fan speeds to 100% in MSI afterburner it only controls the fan over the GPU heat sink. Right now I have it overclocked @ 1500 MHz and the memory overclocked to an effective speed of 8000 MHZ although this is not necessary for other users its nice to know it can hit that reliably and stay stable in games. It's \"military class\" components and awesome cooling design definitely help there. This card takes voltage like no one else it is incredibly easy to overclock to 1500 MHZ(200-300 MHZ over stock boost) using simple YouTube guides and get a 1000 MHz increase memory overclock. It seriously increases the longevity of this card for future gaming, it hits well above 85 FPS in most games, that aren't capped of course, on very high and ultra settings. Also with good case ventilation I haven't seen this card go past 60 C once while overclocked! At idle depending on ambient temps its stayed between 26C-30C\n\nStock:\nStock this card still shines bright. I have found no AA or AAA title this card doesn't excel with, in no game I have played has it gone lower than 70-75 FPS except for where certain games are capped at 60 maximum, it is an amazing card that will last quite some time. Also important to note the card is dead silent and cool. It idles at near ambient temps at 25C and stayed between 45-55C in testing.\n\nSo in conclusion:\n\nPros:\nBeast of a card- can easily handle all games and future games for the next 2-3 years no problem on high, very high or ultra\nStays cool regardless of overclocking or not\nTakes overclocking like a champ\nHardcore components that allow overclocking longevity: HI C capacitors, solid capacitors and super ferrite chokes, mean it can take higher voltages and temps easily\nSuper Quiet!\n\nCons:\nLacks a back plate- would like to see a ventilated back plate to help with rigidity, this card is quite long and heavy and the pcb has the slightest bend to it-not detrimental but would like to see one for at least aesthetic appeal\nSize-You must have a decent size case for this card, luckily the Fractal Define S handles it no problem, it's quite large due to that awesome twin frozr cooler and the lengthy thick PCB to help with overclocking and heat dissipation\n\nReccomendations:\nMAKE SURE YOUR PSU HAS TWO 8 PIN PCI POWER CONNECTORS!!!!!-this card is factory overclocked and has some serious power requirements, I recommend at least a 80 PLUS Bronze or higher power supply with a 750 Watt rating, 500 watts as they recommend isn't enough headroom if you run a i5 like me or an i7.\nCase ventilation and size- this card is almost 11 inches long and 4.5-5 inches wide so make sure your case can accommodate it Also I recommend at least one intake fan with a filter pulling fresh cool air into the case towards the front of the GPU so it doesn't have to deal with higher case temps in the future.\n\nALL IN ALL: This card is worth the money if you are looking for a long term gaming GPU and is worth the $500 price tag, however if you have the extra +$180 at the time of this review and want something that will last even longer a 980 Ti from MSI would be a good choice, for me when I bought this card the 980ti came out like a week after purchase but this was so worth the money"}, {"title": "Excellent video card! Some caveats to be aware of.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2014", "text": "I bought this card around a month ago as an upgrade over the EVGA GTX 670 FTW Edition that I had before. It was during the period where 980s were in very short supply and there was a lot of price gouging by 3rd-party sellers and I managed to snag one of these from Amazon at retail price. This past month, I have had literally no problems with this card and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.\n\nPros:\nQuiet: the fans on this card completely turn off when the temperature is under 50 C (see note at the bottom). This results in silent normal operation but when the card gets hot, the fans turn on quickly and stabilize the temperature. But they are still no louder than my case fans and I can barely hear the GPU fans while gaming. Additionally, I have not noticed any coil whine that has troubled numerous other 980 and 970 models.\n\nCool: I have not seen the GPU temp exceed 67 C even while playing demanding games like BF4 and AC: Unity at maximum settings. The driver-operated fan manages to maintain this temperature at 50% speed, which is impressive, though the second fan is VBIOS-controlled and could be running at a different speed. Idle temp is around 32 C, which is pretty good for a card whose fans aren't even running at that temperature. The cooling solution is more effective than the blower fan on my old 670 by far.\n\nFast: This is one of the best-performing cards on the market at this time. Boost clocks are 1327 MHz on my card and it can handle everything I throw at it. I'm running BF4 at max graphics except for no antialiasing at 120% resolution scale and I normally get over 100 FPS. I can smoothly play AC: Unity at maximum graphics settings including TXAA without any stuttering or frame drops. Basically this thing can handle everything you can throw at it at 1080p without any problems.\n\nCons:\nPrice??? Not really a con, but $580 isn't cheap. But you get what you pay for and you're getting a lot.\n\nMSI Live Update: it doesn't work on my system. I can't get my VBIOS version information or any useful info out of this application.\n\nCaveats: not really cons, but things to be careful of.\n\nVBIOS: The default video card BIOS that came with my card had a bug where it would say the fan is running at 1% of its max speed even though the fan wasn't actually spinning. A video BIOS update from MSI fixed it, but as far as I know, this BIOS update has to be found on the MSI forum, not via its update utility. The new BIOS also seemed to tweak the fan profile; the fan now starts spinning when the temp reaches 50 C. I vaguely remember that the fan would start at 55 C using the old BIOS. Neither issue is actually problematic as the fans are so effective and they start properly, but it's something to keep in mind: VBIOS update beneficial.\nHOWEVER, if you plan to use the newer Nvidia drivers, you MUST update your bios as the newer drivers (after 344.16) don't work well with the old bios. This is a BIOS problem, so newer drivers require newer VBIOS.\n\nDrivers: I have heard that there are problems with the past few NVidia graphics drivers. I'm running an old version, 344.16, which most people say is stable and has been perfectly stable in my experience. I am using an HDMI connection and those with DisplayPort and UHD screens might have issues with this driver (these appear to be fixed in the latest beta driver 344.80).\n\nSize: Make sure you know how long this card is! I bought this card basically on a whim as it was the only one available at a reasonable price. This card is an inch longer than a standard card and might not fit into smaller cases. I was lucky and it just barely fits in my Zalman mid-tower case. Check the specs!\n\nTrivia: You get an MSI gaming mousepad along with the video card. It's a nice, large, stable mousepad with plenty of friction for precise mouse movements, but it has a strong plastic smell that fortunately dissipates with time.\n\nOverall I could not be happier with my purchase. This video card and the GPU within are great in every respect."}, {"title": "2022 Gaming PC", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2022", "text": "The 4GB VRAM is this card's only real limitation. I got it here for $325. It came wrapped in an anti static bag and several layers of bubble wrap. Looks and performs like a brand new card. Out performs a more expensive 1050ti because of the 256-bit memory bus and it overclocks easily with afterburner because of it's excellent cooling (with good case airflow.) I can play most modern titles at 1080p on medium or high settings and get decent frame rates. Textures and draw distance are limited by the 4 GB VRAM but in the current shortage it is just the ticket for a mid range gaming build. Paired with an i7 4790k, 16GB DDR 3, it's a great PC that will easily last to the end of the Win10 life cycle. Seller came through as promised."}, {"title": "Sexy.Sturdy.Silent", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2015", "text": "Ok this is amazing. PURELY AMAZING! So I myself haven't been able to use it in a computer I built yet, but My friend recently built a computer and I asked whether I could use his PC to test this card out and he agreed. He had a Z97-A and 4690K. Now on with the review:\n\nBuild Quality:\nThere was no sag, and the card felt sturdy and well built, I wish a backplate came included though. It was hard to mount in the S340 though, since the expansion slot and expansion slot holes were a bit hard to line up. It's not very long, which is good since MSI managed to fit amazing components and keep the PCB a size that would fit in most cases.\n\nAesthetics:\nI think this card looks like a boss, and believe it or not, its a bit customizable. Now some people think that you can only use this in red and black builds, but you can dismantle the fan shroud super easily by getting the screws out, and painting them whatever you want. I painted mine black and white, and it looked sexy. The LED is white, and its not too bright either. There's even a small engraving on the side of the card saying dragon army.\n\nNoise:\nThe MSI GTX 980 is extremely quiet. This is because during idle the fans spin off, and start to spin once the card gets to 60 degrees. I think its 60 degrees, might be a little less. However even when spinning, it's extremely quiet, no noticeable coil whine while running Folding@Home which puts both the CPU and GPU to 100 percent. While gaming and benchmarking it was also quiet.\n\nPerformance:\nObviously, it's a total beast. I was getting above 60 FPS on FurMark (Core),Unigine 4.0 (Extreme Preset), and GTA V with maxed out settings at 1080p Once I started overclocking it (on one wire delivering power so it could be more stable) i got 1520 mhz while barely raising the power target, but since there was one wire, i didn't want to risk stability. Overclocking depends on silicon lottery, and I got pretty lucky.\n\nConclusion: Would I buy it again? Yes. Do I think the 970 is bang for buck? No, because the price has dropped down to 500 bucks for this, and the R9 390 outperforms the 970. So I would say, this does bring more bang for buck compared to the 970. Sadly however, I do plan on selling this and getting a Zotac AMP! Extreme 980 Ti. However, I would recommend this variation of the 980 as it is a fantastic card that should last you a while."}, {"title": "Fantastic card.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2015", "text": "This is a fantastic card. Of course to run such a powerful card, it has to be coupled with equally powerful supporting hardware like CPU, RAM etc.\n\nThe performance output of this card is 100%. At least till now, i will see when the new-gen games of 2015 come out, but till now for the games of 2014, it's output is 100%, not a single loss of frame while running in High / Ultra settings. Apply V-Sync and you get a solid 60 FPS, lift it up and you go beyond 150 FPS, apply 4X MSAA and you get a minimum of 130-140 FPS on BF4, that's with all other settings to Ultra.\n\nNow comes the card's hardware, it is super quiet, while running the card at idle with 39-40 degrees temperature, i ducked down to look at the fans, they were at a complete stop. It's the new technology of Twin Frozr V design, the fans will only start spinning once the card heats up during load, after playing graphics intensive games like BF4 and Dragon Age Inquisition, i noticed the temperatures went upto 60-66 degrees which is totally normal.\n\nThe card is a little large, trust me if it looks like previous MSI GTX 600 or 700 series cards in videos or in pictures, it's larger in its actual self. I have a GZ-G1 Plus Gigabyte case, the case is big enough with very good ventilation, but i had to struggle installing the card, i had to tilt it to just get it into the case lol. But overall you won't be disappointed with the card.\n\nThings to note: It comes with two 8-pin power connector sockets, so make sure your PSU is at least having 8-pin power connectors or 6+2 pin power connectors. Avoid installing this card in a thin / small casing, you need a medium to large case to accommodate this card. Other things to note, it doesn't have a DVI-D display port, only a DVI-I among other HDMI and other display ports.\n\nIf your monitor doesn't have a DVI-I slot, don't worry your DVI-D cable will work fine with this card provided the maximum refresh rate of your monitor is 60Hz, just connect your monitor to this card using a DVI-D (Single or Dual Link) cable in case you don't have a DVI-I cable.\n\nBut if your monitor's refresh rate is 120Hz, you will definitely need a DVI-I or a DVI-D (Dual Link) cable, single link DVI-D cable won't be enough since the lesser pins can't transmit the required digital signals.\n\nBest of luck."}, {"title": "card is great, guys", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2014", "text": "card is great, guys. I totally forgot about the 0db fan thing, so I freaked out a bit. I ran heaven benchmark, and the second fan began to spin at 65c. The card stayed between 65c-68c throughout the rest of the benchmark which is awesome. In idle, I get around 35-37c when fans are not spinning :D! The only way to control both fans with a fan speed is to DL their VGA fan control app from their site. I haven't tried it yet because I have no need to. The oc mode, and gaming mode, etc works great. Just a click here, and a click there and it's all set-up. This is my first MSI card because I normally go for EVGA, but I liked the design, color, and overall awesome temp control this card has. I do not overclock, or adjust voltages so i do not have a say on how well this card overclocks, but at stock overclock it's awesome. I'm sure it has even greater O.C potential because of the awesome temperatures. Obviously max's all games out on the market, and I will be picking up another one very soon.\n\nAlso, MSI logo lights up white, the card is a bit thick because of the pipes, and has NO backplate. The PCB is black though, so the look with no back plate is not too bad.\n\n*Forgot to add, on the gaming app where you choose your OC mode, gaming mode, and silent mode, there is a \"cool down\" mode where fans spin at maximum speed to cool your GPU off even faster. It takes your high temp and brings it to idle temps within 40 seconds. You only do it every 5 minutes. I thought it was a cool feature :)\n\n****UPDATE 1-23-15: I have had this card close to three months now it still performs beautifully. I bought another and now have SLI configured. The only GRIPE I have with these cards is that one of the damn fans spin at 800rpm, on both cards, every 15-20secs and then stops. I have read into this issue and people say it is a BIOS problem and I will have to update the cards BIOS. I am not going to do that because I may brick the card, and my cards are working fine as is. People have also said that reverting back to a specific driver will make it stop as well. Now I am not sure who the culprit is here: NVIDIA or MSI. All I know is that updating the BIOS seems to cure the issue.

Well done Nvidia, and well done MSI. If you are considering any of the GTX 980's, I think the MSI Gaming is by far the best choice even though it lacks a backplate like the ASUS and EVGA cards. This card just screams quality and when you take it out of the box, you will gasp. It is perfection. I've been building computers for almost 20 years now, and I have to say this is probably the most amazing graphics card I've ever had.\n\nThe card certainly isn't cheap and is overkill for 80-90% of users out there, but for those that need, and want (and can afford) it, it is the card to get. The MSI Gaming GTX 980 is so quiet it's unbelievable. The Twin Frozr fans stay off until the card hits mid 60s(C), but MSI has a cool app called Independent Fan Control, on its website which lets you set the fan speed however you want. I personally prefer fans on at all times on a high end graphics card, so I keep mine running at 30% and they make NO noise at all. During gaming I set them to 50% (and you can set each fan to different speeds if you want), and they are still silent. Completely. Temps hover around 60-63C under full load.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any coil whine or fans issues like early 970-980s had either. They seem to have worked out all those probs now, and this card runs perfectly.\n\nI'm using the card on a ASUS PB278Q 1440p monitor and games look absolutely stunning in 1440p.\n\nThere are absolutely no cons for this card other than the price. If you can afford it and have a solid CPU, get one now. If you only game or use 1080p though, it's prob more than you need. I'm planning on getting a second ASUS 1440p monitor here shortly so we'll see how it does then, and I may even add a second one if needed.\n\nHighest marks MSI.

If you are running at 1080p resolution then you will be able to run everything at Ultra while this baby isn't even making a squeak of noise. The Twin Frozr V technology let's only one fan go to work under light load(lower temperatures) but the other fan will kick in once the temperatures start going up. I'm currently running a triple monitor setup(5760x1080p) and while I can't get 60FPS on most games on Ultra, I can still get a stable 30FPS. And to be quite honest, that is amazing considering I haven't even overclocked this baby yet. I do plan on purchasing another 980 in the future once the price starts to lower but if you are going for multi-monitor gameplay I would recommend getting two 970s instead of one 980. The performance will be better for 15% more cost. If you are running one monitor at up to 2k resolution then one of these should be no problem.\n\nPros:\nRuns extremely quiet when not gaming thanks to Twin Frozr V technology\n\nMSI Gaming app allows you to fine tune as well as use multiple presets for your graphics cards to customize performance over noise\n\nGreat design with LED MSI Logo(Yes this is a pro, it will look good with window cases\n\nDSR capability will allow you to render at higher resolutions thanks to downsampling.

Most cards that have an output layout like this are fake and, seeing reviews from people saying it won't run DX11, I'm inclined to believe this isn't even a 6770 as those did run DX11. The listed clock speed is about 200mhz lower than the original cards which, at best, points to these being faulty cards flashed with a different BIOS to operate at a lower clock speed. HD 5770s and 6770s (same card with 2 names) also NEVER came with 4GB of VRAM.\n\nAgain, this points to this being a card with a fake BIOS. I've tested another faked GPU claiming to be a GTX 960 4GB and the card even reported itself as such to the computer. In actuality it was a GT640 with 1GB of VRAM. When a game would try to utilize the reported 4GB of VRAM that didn't exist, it would cause the computer to crash.\n\nBest case scenario here, you get a GPU that was originally released in 2009 (as the 5770, again, identical to the 6770...AMD just renamed the same card 2 years later) which has not received driver support since 2015, running at 76% of it's original speed (which may be how it gets away without a 6 pin power connector...but I doubt it) and have to spend some time dialing in settings to avoid games using more than 1GB of VRAM so the computer won't crash.

It is a complicated graphic card and I only wish they could make these more simple. Honestly I am thinking the black screen is caused by the GPU overheating.

Before that had used a Sapphire HD 6870 that STILL runs fine to this day (7 yrs old) but shopping for a newer model Asus had the best deal at the first of this month. Missed the end of Sept deals that were available...ggrrrrr. Same thing happened yrs ago (2012) when I was going for the HD 7970 at the end of Sept, they were reasonable, Oct rolled around and $200.00 was added on. That is when the bitcoin crowd started cornering the market so they could get themselves a Titan card.\nThis yr it was around a $90.00 jump from Sept to Oct. All I can say is since I have an Asus MoBo I decided to go for the Asus card, not to mention the price difference. I've heard good things about the Asus cards and will update as things roll on.\nI will say that as far as performance goes the RX as opposed to the R9 is faster in the games I choose to play by a minimum of 50 FPS. Don't get me wrong the Dual-X R9 280 was a rebranded 7970 and when it ran it ran well but it did draw a lot of power anywhere from 200 to 500 watts whereas the RX is about half that and it only needs one 8 pin connection.\nAll in all very satisfied with the Asus model RX580 OC although the OC (the OC is about 1% tho) anyone moving from a R9 type will not be disappointed."}, {"title": "Works Great for 1080p", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021", "text": "I held off on this review for awhile, but now seems appropriate to write this. Pretty good GPU for when I bought it, $230~240 about Aug. 2019. Paired it with a r5 2600x, and they worked fine with minimal bottleneck. Couple months back I bought a r7 3700x, and the bottleneck has greatly widened. I had hoped to pair my 3700x with a EVGA 3080 FTW3, but GPU shortages as they were/are it was not possible, thus I still use my rx580.

If you don't have one and your GPU is under 400w, this is not the card for you (note - I am using a 6pin to 8pin adapter on mine).\n\nI have done some limited overclocking using Overdrive but since Im pretty much getting 60+ fps on everything there really isn't any point.\n\nIf you have anything below a 1050ti, this is a great upgrade for the price. I have a 1050ti in another system and frankly there is no real difference on the games I play.

That with the Asus cooling to which I'm reviewing, it makes for a great addition to an aspiring hardcore rig.\nPros:\n-Built in heat detection that keeps the fans off until a warm 55C is present, keeping a idling or a low load rig from making too much noise.\n-Overclocking is very possible while being able to keep the card at a safe heat index.\n-Graphics card can handle nearly any modern triple A title and then some. Make sure you don't get bottlenecked by your processor, you don't want to hold it back.\n-Great price for a higher mid range graphics card with a great cooling system.\n\nCons:\n-Cooling fans can get quite noisy if the load is heavy. Your typical modern games with an impressive graphics load will usually cause this.(surprise)\n-Because it's a mid-range card, this card will have problems with very heavy games graphically, but will usually triumph the game if settings are set a bit lower then max graphical settings(cri ;~;).\n\nEven if this card is a mid-range power graphics card, it competes and will dominate almost any game you have in store for it, and make it look great.
