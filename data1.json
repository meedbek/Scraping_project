It outperforms it's competitors and some of the Nvidia vanilla cards without demanding a new power supply, assuming you have a 400W or above already. Unlike the original 1650 and lower models, this requires a 6-pin PCIe connector, which isn't asking much considering it being just a bit above the limit where you wouldn't need one, this card does however run hot, was nearing 80C on Ultra playing Dead By Daylight (thanks again to Asus for the free game back in 2016 from my 950 mini purchase), I did not pay attention to the other settings, just switched to Ultra and started playing, it's not perfect, however, even on ultra I was still getting noticeably better performance than my now broken Zotac 1050 Ti that was struggling on medium, that shows the huge loop in performance just within the next line of cards and having the OC addition of an already upgraded card. Though, Nvidia made their lineup rather confusing and a bit frustrating for some this time around, especially for those who have already chosen the vanilla 1650 which happens to be the same price at the moment, I appreciate their effort into making a card (from all manufacturers) that despite it's inferior specs to some of the competition, can still outperform some of those cards, whether all the time or at some point in a game, depending on the model of course, and without the need to upgrade to more power, sizable form-factors, and even specs, which shows that even that doesn't tell the whole deal on performance. The only real downside about this I can say is it seems a little fragile with what looks to be thinner PCB, shroud, and backplate, and it runs very hot, especially boosted. What I do like about the card is Asus's effort into thinking about other factors in design like dust-resistance and fan bearings. I've had 3 cards fail because the bearings would wear out within a year or two and start grinding without even many hours into the games, or at least many being the \"typical\" gamer average, I'm talking failure within about 5 hours of playing a demanding game after just doing minor graphical tasks on every other instance for the span of 1-2 years. After the card nears 80, it does downclock at some point so that it could get back into the mid-70s without a huge performance loss but temperature is certainly its weak point; the heatsink and overall heat dissipation setup is rather small as well, so that doesn't help. After having 3 cards fail, longevity has been my main concern; these little cards just seem to give out rather early. I'm hoping the new bearings, IP5X dust-resistance, and technology behind the card will help its lifespan, and that the heat won't become an issue for the card itself, performance, and rest of my components. With a 1850+Mhz clock boost, at its size, it's power requirements, and it's performance, this thing is a beast in a compact package, not just with what it can do but the thought behind the specs and technology of the card and its components as well. It's nice to see a company for once make a positive change, and not release the same exact design for a basic card despite the lineup difference. Hopefully other companies can take note and start using something like ball bearings for their fans and take into account little issues vulnerable components can face and put more thought into their cards, however, with this Asus, temperature is the only real concerning problem that I would say maybe they haven't put much thought into as far as that regard, maybe all out performance was their focus, or maybe didn't think it would be an issue? Either way, this is a nice card, I chose this version over the Zotac mainly because of the bearings and tech behind it, also it was only $5 more and is factory OC'd. After 3 bad Zotac experiences, I think my choice was justified.\n\nPros:\n\n*Excellent performance for its class and size.\n\n*Fairly compact single fan design with minor fitting issues I ran into with the backplate needing to budge/be pulled hard and held toward the screw holes to put the screws in.\n\n*Extra thought into the design of some of the most important components\n\n*Does look nice imo with the \"ASUS Geforce GTX\" font on the side while viewing inside the case.\n\nCons:\n\n*Runs hot with small heat dissipation setup and not much that can be done to resolve the issue\n\n*Could have looked a little nicer in terms of aesthetics but with something like this already, that's just nitpicking, though I'm sure it could have been done.\n\n*Packaging might have been missing stuff, or ditched GPU Tweak II CD but it might have been done intentionally on this model. Box is rather barebones once you lift the cardboard holding the card, so I feel it could have been downsized to save on materials.\n\nMix:\n\n*build quality seems just average, or less than what I'd like it to be, just a standard card made to do one job, but feels a little fragile with what seems to be thinner parts and some low-quality feeling materials. Hard to tell its durability and strength. The PCB and backplate seem a little thinner than usual or what I'm used to, and the plastic shroud just feels lightweight/cheap and/or thin of itself, not sure about the actual quality of all the components though. Could just be using not necessarily lower-grade but different materials. Who knows? Could end up being better, at least I hope.\n\nUPDATE: 3/23/21. ASUS, please keep using ball-bearing fans and I'll buy your cards every single time, since no other company seems to think about fan design and longevity, my last 3-4 cards died between 1 and 3 years from fan-failure because the sleeve bearings would go bad and start grinding from drastic temperature changes after playing some demanding games."}, {"title": "Perked up my old Lenovo", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2020", "text": "I purchased this to replace the factory installed GT730 on my Lenovo Ideacentre 710-25ISH I bought from Best Buy six or so years ago. I tried streaming Train Simulator 2020 on Twitch and a friend commented that the capture was laggy. I had noticed that my PC would take a hit on frames in high traffic areas, and could only play on medium detail settings at best. I purchased an EVGA 750 G5 Gold-Series modular power supply at the same time as the 1650 to ensure I had more than enough juice for the new GPU before installation. The GPU was larger than I expected but still left plenty of room in the case. I liked the black with white racing stripes design but as I don't have a clear case it will (hopefully) be a long time before I see it again. The GPU plugged right into the PCI slot and snugged right in to the backing plate once it was secured. This GPU did require me to remove a second backing plate in order for it to fit properly, my old 730 only took up the one. This GPU also requires a 4-pin plug connection from the PSU to power it; it will not receive power solely from the PCI slot. I haven't had enough time in Train Simulator to take actual FPS readings, but can tell you the game now runs at its highest detail settings like butter. Zero lag, very smooth, and the added detail is like night and day. This is a great GPU that offers a budget upgrade without hogging up all the space in a tower and demanding a ton of power."}, {"title": "So far, the best value entry level gaming PLUS streaming.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2020", "text": "I bought this thinking I might be able to stream 1080p 60fps but BEWARE there will be a LOT of stutters, duplicated frames during the stream/recording. I do either 900p or 720p for smooth streaming and gaming. Make sure to run OBS as administrator. If you're looking to play and stream at the same time and you don't have a lot of money to spend, this card is a go.\n\nHere are my thoughts. I'm pretty sure you've watched reviews on Youtube but here goes anyways. If you haven't, though, you should.\nNoise: The fans only ramp up during streaming and gaming where the GPU has to work extra hard, otherwise, barely audible if you have a completely quiet room. If you have either speakers or normal headphones, you won't be able to hear the noise at all.\n\nPerformance: You really get what you pay for. You can play triple A games at low or medium settings at 1080p 60fps EASILY. This card doesn't even sweat. As long as you don't ask for too much, you'll be satisfied for sure.\n\nThermals: Averages around 70-75 degree Celsius under full load. Peaks at 75 degrees when you play demanding games for hours, it doesn't go above that at all if you don't overclock it. It's already factory overclocked and still has some room for overclocking.\n\nOverall, this card is one of the best, if not THE best entry level graphics card, and you add streaming to that value. You can't really go wrong with this card. It won't disappoint you. You might think it's bad because of the bad reputation that the normal 1650 has, but this card is on another level. For $20 more bucks, you get 40% more performance than the normal GTX 1650, the new NVENC encoding with Turing architecture for streaming, and in this card's case, overclocked, quiet and excellent cooling."}, {"title": "Pretty loud fans, but great budget performance.", "rating": "4", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2020", "text": "Please keep in mind I purchased this card at $180. I would recommend against paying for the Winter 2020 price of this card, as the performance is definitely not worth the current price.\n\nI may have got an excellent copy, but this card can sit at 2GHz overclock pretty happily. Many games can run at 1080 60fps at high or ultra, but you do tend to see the limitations of 4GB VRAM. For workstation usage, having the new NVENC encoder is great for working in Premiere, but again more VRAM would be nice. I don't run many AAA titles but expect to run them around medium-high, which for me is definitely acceptable.\n\nIn terms of the actual TUF 1650S, while I did look for a dual fan for better noise, this card is still pretty loud. It gets annoying when you need to restart your computer often. I believe it isn't the actual air moving, but the fans themselves, as running older cards with different fan designs are much quieter.

This card benchmarks similar or better performance than a nVidia 2070 Super, at a much lower price! That's always been AMD's A game, best bang for the buck, and they've hit that spot again.\n\nNow specifically about this card. I was leary about spending less on a card when the \"bigger name\" brands are $30-$100 more, but I've had XFX cards in the past and they've worked just fine, so I gave this one a shot.\n\nOut of the box, this card was MUCH larger than I expected. I had to move around SATA ports just to get it to fit. I expected it to be around the size of my RX480, but I way underestimated that! So know going in you need to make sure your motherboard layout isn't going to be effected by this card's size. It's much wider and longer than any previous AMD card I've seen.\n\nNow, as for the performance. On boot, everything seemed great. I've always had problems with AMD's drivers, they're notorious for having buggy, crashing driver releases. I've always had multiple system crashes when doing clean installs of AMD's graphics drivers in the past. But doing a complete clean driver install worked flawlessly, no crashes on the driver install. Huge pleasant surprise!\n\nThen I tried playing some games to start testing the performance. That's where I started to run into serious problems. Every game I tried to play, my computer would hard lock. The GPU driver was crashing. Obviously that's incredibly frustrating for a brand new high end graphics card. I tried changing game settings, both in regular gaming and VR, and nothing changed. Drivers would crash every time after getting into the game (though the menus would load fine).\nBefore considering an RMA, I looked into the issue to see how many others were having these problems, and it appears to be a very large number of people. After a couple of hours of digging, I discovered the issue was because the graphics card is overlooked out of the box WAY over stock, and even higher than the highest advertised overclocked cards. This is why it was crashing. This is a serious oversight from a firmware/driver standpoint. The default settings should never be overclocked. The main problem comes from the voltage is set at 1.2mV by default, and the card can't handle that much voltage. You have to undervolt the card, in my case to 0.99mV in order to get the card to run on stock settings.\nThat in itself is a simple enough fix, except that you can't force the card to actually run at those settings by default, you have to use software to change those settings on system startup. And that's where another issue came up. AMD's software for overclocking (or in this case underclocking) their hardware, Wattman, would not save these new settings on startup no matter what I tried. Every boot, even with the software running on startup and the profile saved as default, the card would start with the original default settings. This would be incredibly frustrating to have to manually change the graphics settings on every reboot/crash.\nSo rather than use AMD's software, I had to resort to using other software to manage the settings. In this case MSI AfterBurner. MSI's software has worked flawlessly for years, but it does have issues with compatibility with VR (specifically Oculus), so do keep that in mind if you do a lot of VR gaming.\nThe next issue that I ran into is that apparently AMD's FreeSync does NOT work with this card, at least on the current drivers. So that also had to be disabled, which is incredibly disappointing, but would certainly have to be fixed at some point. So I'm waiting for further driver updates to hopefully be able to turn that back on.\n\nAfter finally getting all of that sorted out, it was finally time to test some games! This thing is an absolute beast for gaming. A massive upgrade from my RX480! I play in 2k resolution, and the RX480 (even if overclocked) would struggle to keep even 30 FPS in some demanding games on high/ultra settings, but not this! I can max out all graphics settings and play at 2k resolution and keep over 60 FPS on every game I've tried! The only notable exception being Star Citizen, but being an Alpha it's terribly poorly optimized, and even the highest end systems struggle to keep 60 FPS everywhere. But I do keep a stable 45 FPS average, which is fantastic. Though most games are able to sustain 144 FPS as well, for an incredible gaming experience! Specially Elite Dangerous stays at 144 FPS even in large battles!\n\nI want to knock more stars off this card just for all the frustration I went through just to get it to even work, but since then I haven't had a single issue with the card. It runs perfectly now! So just go into getting this card (and I would assume other 5700XT boards may have this same issue) knowing that you're going to have to do some tweaks before you'll be able to use it. AMD has the absolute worst driver support, it's downright dreadful. But they've always been this way. If their software team could actually catch up to their hardware team, they'd probably be killing nVidia on all fronts. They just can't.\n\nSo overall, I definitely recommend this card for an upgrade. It was a huge upgrade for me and it's nice to have great gaming performance again. Just know you're going to likely have issues until they sort all of this out!"}, {"title": "2022 AMD Updated Drivers and Fixed Black Screen Issues Card is Amazing", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2022", "text": "This card at launch when I purchased it was plagued with the same video card driver issues AMD has become notorious for in the community.

Keep in mind that all of these improvements whilst still drawing the same power and without overclocking. That's right, stock speed baby.

Can be tempered.", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2020", "text": "I think this is really worth 4.5 stars, but I don't want to short-change it.\n\nThis card is pretty great given that it's usually the more budget-conscious of 5700XT. Which is not to say \"it works fine BUT...\" We've skipped some RGB but have a metal backplate and metal accents on a very solid-feeling shroud. Personally I don't care what the shroud feels like - I'm not going to really hold the thing. Make it look nice and call it a day. But the metal brackets and plates don't seem to hurt anything. An aggressive-looking shroud too, but not to a degree that it becomes cringey.\n\nIt's easy to lose reference on size in GPU cards especially when looking at dual-fan designs, and this one is quite large. It has a two-slot interface on the output-end of the card but it has a substantial radiator and does take up three slots worth of space over the motherboard. I had to give up wifi for this. mATX builders take not that you will only really be left with one slot available and miniITX that you may not fit into a tight case.\n\nThe temperatures and fan noise out of the box are the biggest concern here. AMD temperature reporting maybe looks worse than it is, but that isn't to say this card is fairly hot and loud as received due the the factory overclock/overvolt and aggressive fan curves. There is a bios switch to enable a more basic bios with less aggressive fan curves, but while it's easy, it's not going to be the best method of dealing with these issues. Better to use AMD's own Wattman from the Radeon drivers that you'll install anyways and use that to undervolt and tune some clock speeds. There's a very good chance that this will drop your temps enough and keep your fans from running so high. You could further tweak the fan curves to tune the speeds. I know this seems like a lot of overhead and it could encourage you to look elsewhere, but honestly it's not bad and something you should do for any 5700XT. So it's worth doing regardless.\n\nMake sure you have a good power supply, though. Recommended is a 600 W but you'll need both an 8-pin and a 6-pin power. There are adapters included and I won't say they won't work, but conventional wisdom is that you really should use those as a permanent solution. Can't say I've ever heard of it really causing a problem, though.\n\nOverall, I'm happy to have this as it has everything I need and it's very light on the gimmicks. I've got Destiny 2 running at 1440p and highest settings (except lighter AA and no motion blur) around 130-150 fps. A smallish but significant upgrade from my GTX 1080.

I'd recommend avoiding the card.\n\nI purchased a Nitro+ RX 570 8GB from Platinum Micro Inc on 8/29/18 and received the card 9/6/18. My wife and i were about to move so i didn't test the card until 10/4/18 when i found that there was an issue with the card. I tried to trouble shoot the problem myself through the 10/6/18 when i found some postings (see toms hardware, amd support, ect...) , that this was a known issue with the Sapphire cards and likely a bios problem. 17 and 18 series drivers i tried gave me an error reading \"No AMD graphics driver is installed, or the AMD driver is not functioning properly. Please install the AMD driver appropriate for your AMD hardware\" on BIOS 1 and i get frames about the same as my 5 year old 7870 on bios 2. Newer drivers read bios 2 as an RX 580 in GPU-Z and same issue with frame rates. The only way that BIOS 2 functions is with drivers that are almost a year old (17 series drivers) and makes me doubt support for current gen titles coming out this year. I filed for a return on 10/7/18 and was denied as i filed 1 day outside of the window. I first called amazon and asked about their 90 day A-Z guarantee and was told that because the seller was a 3rd party seller the 90 day guarantee didn't apply. I ran through Sapphire support for a few days before they recommended an RMA with their 3rd part RMA company, Althon Micro. Althon Micro has given me an rma number and on their email requested the use of bubble wrap and packing peanuts which with shipping ran about $40. I'm worried though that their fix for the problem is a bios re-flash which would void any factory warranty i have on this card. After this fiasco I'm avoiding sapphire cards.

This GPU has done the job of letting me go anywhere on the internet without video lag.\n\nI had a more expensive NVIDIA GPU in my system with otherwise state of the art hardware. The newest most power Ryzen 9 \\ 5900 CPU, fast memory and a 750 watt power supply. The NVIDIA GPU ran like hot garbage on my Ubuntu system. Ubuntu has a nasty sepia color scheme that saturates the entire OS and everything in it. It is not only ugly but painful to look at due to my vision issues.\n\nI did not know for sure at the time but, I hoped a new video card from someone other than NVIDIA might perform better. Turns out this AMD designed GPU got rid of the nasty sepia tint. This video card creates a simple un-tinted OS that is a pleasure to use. The card is not BIG and uses only the power supplied by the GPU slot.\n\nThe card has some energy saver garbage installed that turns the card off if you power down your monitor. I took a star off for the energy saver mess. There really are no other issues.

that seem to be on peoples mind when contemplating purchasing this exact model rx 5700xt by power color(axrx 5700xt 8gbd6-3dh)\n\nok first this is not a big card, I knew it was going to be on the small side but i did not expect it to be no bigger than the older model rx 570s from the likes of gigabyte or xfx and actually when i hold them up side by side this card is actually smaller than my Nvidia rtx 2060 super founders card and that was a surprisingly small card, so this is a perfect size for the case i have included in the photos thats the case i have put this card into\n--given this cards petite build and very light weight i had ZERO expectations for good thermal management...but continue reading and i think i will effectively covey just how wrong i was about that but keep in mind that this case has the gpu literally right on the side with a massive intake basically spanning the entire side of the case were the pcie slot is so that is undoubtedly influencing my thermals and fan noise\nok on to performance. first lets identify my hardware here with a list of my parts that are in this build so we can get a better idea of how well this runs as a complete product because how useless are gpu performance and thermal numbers without knowing full system specs and how the performance and thermals of a graphics card influences total system performance\n*case - silverstone sugo sg13b mesh\n*cpu - intel i7 8700k\n*cpu cooler - corsair h60(2018) 120mm closed loop liquid cooler\n*motherboard - msi z370i pro carbon mini itx\n*ram - corsair vengance pro ddr4 16gb(2x8gb) at 3600mhz at cas16\n*ssd - samsung 950 pro(first gen) m.2 nVME 512gb ssd for windows 10\n*ssd - silicon power a40 256gb sata 2.5in ssd for a cut down debian linux install for phoronix test suite(for testing)\n*hdd - Western Digital white label 8TB red drive that runs at 5900rpm pulled from a WD external drive\n*psu - Thermaltake white label 700watt 80+ white certified( this was a concern at first as i was not confedent this was going to be able to power all my hardware reliably and altho i have long term usage concerns now after i replaced the 120mm fan with a pwm fan and ran the pwm signal wire to the motherboard for advanced thermal control i am not worried at the moment but i will look into picking up a at least bronze certified of the same specs but also keep in mind that with this form factor the only system fans i have are the intake 120mm for the AIO cooler and the 120mm on the power supply so i needed to mod this in order to have more granular control of both fans and i must say im super stoked that i did because all that in this case makes for a perfect air duct from the front over the board and out the back via the psu now adding a relatively hot GPU into the mix was the last thing i wanted but looking at the total system performance im shur glad i did because of the way this case is built this gpu easily pulls in its own fresh air from the side and throws ip up towards the vents on top so even if this gpu hits 90c on the junction it end up having very little effect on full system temps\nok giving all those specs i was not expecting super high performance even tho there is no reason a i7 8700k cant still handle high fps gaming at a modest 2560x1440 at around 120 to 144fps and to my suprise it did just fine\nok on to the thermals wich is arguably the most concerning for people when considering this card and unless i completely won the silicon lottery it duz not need to concern anybody i fan a full 6 hour stress test in furmark and shur my junction temps came close to 90c but never hit that but the core stayed under 80c the hole time and the memory temps stayed under 60c the whole time, ran ran this stress test in conjunction with a small fft stress on my cpu so i could get a total system thermal worse case and that were these temps came from when i just ran the furmark stress test i didn't come anywhere near this high of temps on the card and all together i dont think i ever got higher than 30c above ambient here in Nebraska were its getting a little chili out lol\nok so here are my final thoughts on this, if you are looking for a amd gpu that is very high performance and you dont want to wait for maybe ever for rdna 2 and you need something that is going to fit into a small case with good airflow this is the card for you also it has the added bonus of being slightly obscure so the prices are usly the lowest for a new rx 5700xt at least at the time of righting this, now that being sead if you can afford the price and physical real estate of going with a bigger card with possibly 3fans you will simply have much better performance numbers and even possibly be able to overclock a little bit (by that i mean allow watt man to overclock for you as its basically fully automated at this point im super excited about that little development as i also have the giant xfx rx 5700xt thik 3 model that is setup with dual bios so i can take one and just go to town on the overclock and push close to 220watts, but thats for a different review that i will also be making here on that once my absolute army of tests is done\nok now to address so other concerns i was reading on other reviews...right now as of today the 15th of October 2020 i am running the latest optional drivers from amd and i am seeing ZERO instability and the thermals and total power consumption are well within spec( at he hottest my card was pulling 180watts) and that is with the stock performance setting on wattman no over volt or overclock or the opposite i didn't under clock anything either i specifically wanted to find out what the OUT OF BOX experience was going to be like so i could put some information out there for others to help them make a decision on this seemingly to good to be true obscure graphics card from power color and i believe i have done that...\\\nmy conclusion is if PCPARTSPICKER list is saying this is the best card that will fit in your build than buy it if there are clear options for bigger cards like the red devil or the asus strix than buy one of those instead or even the xfx thic 3 but i have heard of thermal issues with the thic 2 but in reality if your running a normal size none sff case the 3 fan thic 3 is going to fit its no bigger than any other 3 slot card(actually uses only 2 pcie slots but the card itsslef is super thick and takes up 3 internally) ok but thats not the point here were discussing the axrx 5700xt 8gbd6-3dh\nand on that in my experience everybody can set aside there performance concerns and thermal concerns as long as you have good airflow to it this card will run fine\nps after running all the stess tests i dont think my cards fans were ever hitting above 60% or if they were they were just rely quiet and at idle they are off so all in all its not a load card and keep in mind in my case the gpu intake is literally less than an inch from the side vents so i rely was expecting this to be a bit louder and just to clarify i run this system backwards with the io facing me so the gpu was also facing me and still total syste noise was negligible and actually quieter than when i had the rtx 2060 super fe in here as its idle fan speed was like 40% and ramped up to 90 within 5mins of a stress test now am i disparaging nvidia here for there FE coolers NO i love that card but i put that into an even more space constrained aluminum box from aliexpress its very nice and it is a matx sff build nut that was literally the only high performance modern gpu that would fit as it has the power cables on the side and not the top were there is literly no room in between the side aluminum panel and the top of the gpu so i had to sacrifice my more expensive 2060s on that build and that is why i was looking for a replacement for this one as its an older intel platform and not my primary rig but i jumped into this fully expecting to haf to down clock this to basically a 5700 not xt specs or even a 5600 and for the price i was totaly ok with that and was actually one of the deciding factors in picking this model as it uses the reference pcb the from stock rx 5700xt so future water cooling a gpu inside this RIDICULOUSLY small case was just kind of exciting lol and still not off the table now that i find out this card runs just fine at fully stock and is very competitive with my bigger RTX 2070super FE thats what was rely surprising as i paid 499 for that and no were near that for this and ironically this card will perform way better in linux as it is native MESA vesa and will not need to leverage nvidia to volcan runtime conversions and im no levelonetechs but i know my way around linux and rely enjoy tinkering with it and this will enable some pretty good performance numbers for paired with this easly clocked to 5ghz water cooled 8700k so ya im not regretting this purchase one bit...\nbut dont misunderstand me if i find any problems with this card long term i will definitely update this review and then you as a buyer can decide if those issues are a deal breaker in the future but likely there will already be a slurry of other options out there especially once RDNA2 comes to the DIY space but for now and for a while RDNA1 is what we have available as amd is still leveraging market share from the next gen consoles which are using RDNA2 so they will likely try to enjoy the win there for a while befor putting that tech on the DIYPC market and reaffirming the PC as the performance king over any console that way they get 2 wins and quite frankly after the whole FX dry spel and the rx vega flop they kinda need the wins...\n\n...update...ok so 3 months and one debacle of a election later this card is still working perfectly and is even more stable today still using the optional rolling release drivers as opposed to the slightly older LTS drivers so ya no problembs at all...one slight complaint and it's not even a real one but a superficial one with the light weight feel of the whole card, is it is a small card and since it realy dosnt produce the kinda heat a overclocked card running at over 200watts it dosnt need anything more than a cheap light aluminum cooler stack but it still feels cheap lol ...this dosnt effect performance at all at least in this specific card as it simply dosnt need a more dence cooling solution so no real complaints just that one very first world one lol"}, {"title": "Mostly Reliable", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2020", "text": "I have had this video card since May 18, 2020 and have had no major issues with it. I did have a couple of times where it did black screen on me in the middle of a gaming session, but a driver update resolved the issue and it hasn't happened again since. This card has been mostly reliable except for those couple of aforementioned cases. I mainly play Star Citizen @ 1440p and it performs great for a greatly un-optimized game. This card was an upgrade for an old R9 280X that now has a home in my HTPC/Steam Box."}, {"title": "Good graphics card, no need for higher end models", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2021", "text": "Bought in December on pre-buy and got it by Christmas Eve.

The card was easy enough to install (insert into a free PCIe slot, plug the PCIe power in, install drivers as necessary) but there's one serious issue (which isn't specific to just PowerColor cards, as it affects pretty much all AIBs (which is why I give it a 3/5 stars) - the firmware and drivers are poorly written! Thanks AMD! When it works, it works great. When it doesn't, you better hope you can easily do a hard reset on your PC and that you save your work pretty darn often. If you're looking for a video card of this caliber, get any RTX 2060 Super instead as they don't have poorly written firmware."}, {"title": "A beefy graphics cards", "rating": "5", "location-date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2021", "text": "Made a right decision purchasing this card back in October when it was only $379 with many bad reviews about crashing.
