                    "text": "OK, it arrived on time, but that is sort of an issue. When I purchased this product, Amazon guaranteed delivery on Sunday Feb. 6, 2022. On the 6th, I woke up to an email that it would be delayed until Monday the 7th. No problem, we had a blizzard and people have been digging out. BUT, it was delivered on Sunday and just left outside, in the freezing cold and snow, without me knowing or expecting it was going to happen. Luckily, a friend stopped in for five minutes, and by coincidence that's when the package was left in the cold and snow, so it wasn't there when he came up the porch, but it was there when he went down and my package got to me safely. The seller bears no responsibility for this, as it was fulfilled by Amazon, but for some reason, Amazon doesn't let us write reviews for the customer service, so here it is. You can do better, Amazon.\n\nAs for the product itself, it's not really as bad as my \"stars\" would suggest. It arrived in what appears to be brand new packaging. I can't find any evidence that the anti-static bag was ever opened before. I installed it in my aging Dell Inspiron 3700 (with an i5-8400, and 12GB of RAM) hooked it all up, turned it on, and after about 5 minutes of some installation process (at which time there WAS video) my screen automatically reverted to the display settings it had prior to the install, and it works just fine. I installed Nvidia GeForce and, after one more driver update it was over. The entire process was from start to finish was less than 20 minutes.\n\nThis was the first time I have ever installed a GPU, and I can only assume that that is EXACTLY how it is supposed to work. As for the value for money, NO GPU has a good value to money ratio. Crypto-miners and the pandemic have seen to that.\n\nAs for gaming, this just is NOT a card built to plays today's most advanced games. I got this card because PGA 2K21 can only track one profile at a time, so two people with two profiles need two copies of the game to track their stats in co-op. Now, my aging Dell could manage about 25 FPS in \"potato mode,\" a number that made it unplayable. With this card, on low settings (one step up from potato mode), this card and the i5 deliver 90FPS steadily at 1080p quality.\n\nThe problem there, is that 2K21 is really \"The Golf Club 3\" with 2K's marketing slapped on the box. As such, the entire install from Steam was just 6.6GB. And as every modern gamer knows, the 5-15GB game file size was lost to any game above the 'indie\" classification when the games went 4K. Which means that the game would have to still be in potato mode if 4K textures even existed in the files for processing.\n\nThe only other \"modern\" game I have on the Dell is Kerbal Space Program. And that, with low settings turned on, and the FPS locked to 80, this card and the i5 can get maintain a steady 60 in the assembly buildings and launchpad, and dropped into the 40 FPS range during the launches I tested. But that is normal. KSP can make even monster PC's cry for mercy if the user launches a big enough ship. The limitation there is far more CPU dependent than GPU dependent as the game tries to simulate physics, heat, and gravity calculations on hundreds of individual parts simultaneously.\n\nAs for video streaming, honestly, I don't see very much improvement over the streaming quality of just the i5, but there is no LESS quality to the streaming, and that's what matters. My monitor is a 32\" 1440p, with a 144 Hz refresh rate.\n\nI do, however, have a couple of issues with this card. On the product description page, there is clearly a picture of the various output I expected to find on this card. And if I remember right that picture had a display port, an HDMI port, a 24 pin DVI port, and a VGA port (I might be wrong about the VGA port). The card that arrived at my house, does NOT have either a VGA port or a display port. So, if your monitor has either of those, BUYER BEWARE!!! I was only ever going to use the HDMI port, so I'm not too fussed.\n\nMy bigger issue is the plastic shroud on the GPU itself. The card doesn't cover the same amount of area that the plastic shroud does, so I have several square inches of exposed plastic shroud inside my PC, acting as a \"bowl\" to catch any dust flying around. And while the Dell has a paper filter the covers the main air intake, and a sort of cone directing the CPU exhaust directly out into the room and that has kept the amount of dust inside my case to a minimum. But now there is the GPU fan sourcing air from an unfiltered area, and just exhausting the air inside the case. So, ALL bets are off as to how this plays out in the remaining life left in my aging Dell.\n\nThat is just BAD design all the way around. It uses more material than is strictly needed meaning the manufacturer is paying more than is strictly necessary for each card manufactured, and it CAN'T be good for the PC to have an actual dust catcher inside a machine that you work hard to keep dust free. And I can PROMISE the manufacturer, that if my aging Dell suddenly dies six weeks from now, I know EXACTLY who I will blame. I won't get a refund, but THEY won't get a return customer.\n\nAnd for that reason, ultimately, I will give this GPU a 3-star rating with a serious \"BUYER BEWARE\" due to the misleading product photos, as well as the poorly designed fan shroud."

It fits perfect and doesn't overlap on the 2240 M.2 SATA SSD (See photos). After installation NVIDIA program recognized the GPU and updated the software automatically. I'm not using this for games but I am using DreamWeaver, Photoshop, Illustrator etc... as well as ZOOM for online college courses and a couple of other graphics demanding programs. I didn't have to mess with or update the BIOS, it was simply plug and play. Temperature wise it stays pretty cool. The only modification was having to exchange the original GPU bracket with this 1030 bracket. It worked out fine. (See Photos)"

                    "text": "I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production. Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.) Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)\n\nThe only complaints I do have are about the cooling. The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself. It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.) This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out. I emphasize some because of two things. First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.) I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.\n\nI also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.) I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible. I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade. When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.) It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.\n\nThere was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.) For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape. This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it. For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime. For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.) Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting. Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.) Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)\n\nNow, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud. I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all. I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.) Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.) Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature. The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.) It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so. That 85% was only for a short duration.) I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening. Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier."

My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling."

In this configuration, the GPU was running at >80c and throttling down to <750MHz. Now that I've installed a couple more intake fans in the front, I get a reliable >1700MHz performance at <65c.

The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nArrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this computer based on that alone."

I upgraded from the Rtx 2060 super and I can really tell the difference in frames at 1440p on my 165hz monitor, it\u2019s been about six months now and I haven\u2019t had any problems. But I will say that It can get kinda loud, I don\u2019t notice most of the time bc it\u2019s only in intense gaming and the game is usually loud too so unless I take my headset off I don\u2019t notice it. But it may be an issue if you have other people in the room trying to sleep or what not.it\u2019s fans have an option to stay off tho when using low power so that helps a lot to offset the noise issue. But anyway, this papacy all of my games at any setting I want and after using it for six months I can safely recommend this card to anyone, especially at its current price of ~600$ right now"

The only complaint that I have, is that it is way too bulky and big for my custom gaming desktop. I am not sure why but it just takes up so much space! Not to mention that you have to use the PSU cables, just to plug it up. (I am not really a fan of GPUs that require you to plug something up to it) It's asking price is pretty debatable too and they are becoming harder to find online! Hopefully when the 4000 Ti graphic card series is finally released to the public, ZOTAC will take notes and make their GPUS a little smaller, a certain percentage cheaper and will not require us to have to use PSU cables. I highly recommend this GPU over the now common 3060 Ti!"

If its below msrp, or even /slightly/ above, its definitely worth buying this card.\n\nNow that my cpu doesn't have to run graphics at the same time as other things (for reference it used to say in task manager my graphics was at 40% when I was using integrated even just basic website idling, now idle its barely at 5%), I have no doubt my computer will run way better and I'll had a better time gaming.\n\nTldr: Amazing card, but its better if you can buy it at a sale price as everything is hella inflated."

Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.\n\nWhile testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth.

I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy. It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game. The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds. Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super. I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570. The frame rates are incredible! Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card. I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream. The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play. I highly, VERY highly recommend this card! It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's. It's worth the price!"

Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I\u2019m using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it\u2019ll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I\u2019ve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I\u2019d expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn\u2019t very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I\u2019ve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card."

I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!"

The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point."

I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don\u2019t think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti.
